.SH NAME
pf2xml \- Convert a parameter-file to XML
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
char *pf2xml( Pf *pf, char *name, char *prolog, int flags )
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
pf2xml converts an Antelope parameter-file to eXtensible Markup 
Language (XML). 

Currently, two output modes are defined. In the default, or 'weak'
conversion mode, four tags are defined, those being pffile, 
pfarr, pftbl, and pfstring. Each may have an optional name as an attribute. 
The composite entities pffile, pfarr, and pftbl may be nested to 
arbitrary depth. pffile and pfarr elements require that their child
elements have non-null names. pftbl elements require that their child 
elements do not have names. A pfstring may be any ASCII-representable string. 

In the 'strong' conversion mode (obtained by setting flags to PFXML_STRONG),
each parameter-file entity name is used as an element, with the type 
specified as an attribute taking the value pfstring, pffile, pfarr, or pftbl.
In the strong mode it is not possible for children of a pftbl element 
to be anonymous, so these elements are given the tag pftbl_entry.

If flags is set to PFXML_NEWLINES, newlines are added after tags 
and values. Otherwise the return value is one long string. Conversion 
errors result in a null value being returned.

If flags is set to PFXML_PRESERVE_PFFILE, elements of type 'pffile' are 
preserved as such. Without this flag (i.e. the default behavior), they are
recast into elements of type 'pfarr'. This remapping allows a parameter file 
to be included in another parameter-file as a sub-component.
