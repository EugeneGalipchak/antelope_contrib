#
#  This is a set of extensions to css3.0.  The entries here do not
#  stand alone as these tables mainly reference attributes defined
#  in css3.0.  These extensions would normally be used with the 
#  database descriptor as:  css3.0:PMEL1.0
#
#  These extensions serve three purposes.  First, the tables define
#  predicted values for measurements in the arrival table that 
#  are based on some earth model and a particular travel time calculator.
#  This should allow future software to not be burdened with matching
#  theoretical travel times to data.  That is, these tables can be used
#  to simply show the predicted value without having to recompute it
#  and worry about whether the results will be consistent.  
#  Secondly, they define extension tables used in the genloc implementation
#  of pmel.  Note this final element was added after the first two 
#  because genloc already looked for some of these tables and I (glp)
#  viewed it better to extend this schema patch rather than add the
#  mess of a long string of extensions in the database descriptor. 
#  Finally, it adds tables for dbpmel that relate to multiple event
#  locations and area grids. 
#
#  WARNING:  these extension can collide with other extension
#  schemas.  In particular, the reftek relations are stolen from
#  iceworm1.3
