.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Metadata is a proverbial problem in data processing.  
By metadata I mean a set of ancillary parameters that are associated with 
a data object.  Some parameters are essential for describing
an object while others are not always needed.  The later 
are what I mean by metadata.  
Dealing with this causes major portability and consistency issues
in data processing.  The traditional solution is using a fixed 
name space through parameters stored as headers.  
The Metadata object provides a more flexible and extendible approach
to dealing with this problem.
.LP
The Metadata class in this library is a generalization of the
idea of a header to store metadata.  
Rather than burden code with different sets of extracted metadata for
each algorithm, the model here is to place the metadata in a private
namespace.  This is a classic use of data hiding and abstraction of
the interface to a concept:  here the pool of metadata is tagged with 
a name key.  The basic idea is that a data object that is to be used in 
some data processing algorithm will include a Metadata object as 
a component of a higher order object.  A good example of how this
is intended is this fragment of the Time_Series object definition
in SEISPP that uses a Metadata object as a component.
.nf
class Time_Series  
{
public:      
	bool live;
        Metadata md;
        double dt,t0;
        int ns;
        Time_Reference_Type tref;
        vector<double>s;
        ...  more components of object definition

};
.fi
Constructors for a Time_Series include methods to copy or
build the Metadata object as part of the Time_Series whose
actual data is stored in the vector<double> STL container. 
This definition of a time series requires start time (t0),
sample interval (dt), and the number of samples (ns).  
Any other elements of special interest are assumed held
in the Metadata object.  
.LP
The Metadata space is created by one of several constructors.
All the constructors for a Metadata object use a default 
set of parameters.  Defaulted parameters are loaded from an 
Antelope parameter file with the fixed name of metadata_default.pf.
This file follows standard rules of pf files using the PFPATH
search method so be cautious as stray parameters are easily
loaded or a program can abort because this file is missing.
The default constructor loads only this set of parameter.
Metadata(char*) uses Antelope's pfcompile function
to append parameter file like input data loaded in the form
a string (char * and string forms are supplied for convenience).  
The Pf constructor, Metadata (Pf*), is similar but appends the
contents of Pf in the Metadata object's namespace.  
.LP
There is a varient of the parameter file constructor with the
calling sequence \fIMetadata(Pf *pfi, string tag)\fR.  
This allows extraction of nested Pf items labelled with "tag"
but containing other parameters within the tagged item. 
The item tagged must be labelled as at &Arr{ parameter file
entry or the contents cannot be parsed correctly.
Here is an example of how this is used in the a program
called pwstack to define parameters for two data objects
called a "Rectangular_Slowness_Grid" and a "Top_Mute":
.nf
P_wave_slowness_grid &Arr{
    uxlow = 0.5
    uylow = 0.5
    nux = 51
    nuy = 51
    dux = 0.2
    duy = 0.2
}
Data_Top_Mute &Arr{
    Time_Reference_Type relative
    Zero_End_Time 1.0
    End_Time 2.0
}
Stack_Top_Mute &Arr{
    Time_Reference_Type relative
    Zero_End_Time 2.0
    End_Time 3.0
}
.fi
.LP
where in this case constructors for these unrelated data objects
use a Metadata constructor to parse the parameter file for the
tags named "P_wave_slowness_grid" for the Rectangular_Slowness_Grid
object and two different Top_Mute objects tagged with "Data_Top_Mute"
and "Stack_Top_Mute".
.LP
The database constructor allows loading metadata from a database.
It's calling sequence is
.nf
Metadata(Database_Handle& dbh,
	Metadata_list& mdl,Attribute_Map& am)
.fi
where dbh is a generic database handle.  In the current implementation
this is a pure abstraction and the only available constructor
assumes dbh is a Datascope database.  That is, the first thing
that happens in this constructor is that dbh is downcast to
a Datascope_Handle object (see dbpp.3) which contains a
datascope Dbptr that is manipulated as usual.
.LP
The attributes that are to be extracted from the database are
driven by this object:
.nf

class Attribute_Map
{
public:
        map<string,Attribute_Properties> attributes;

	Attribute_Map();
        Attribute_Map(Pf *pf,string name);  
        Attribute_Map(string);
        Attribute_Map(const Attribute_Map&);
        Attribute_Map& operator=(const Attribute_Map&);
};
.fi
noting that the STL map container holds the following objects:
.nf
class Attribute_Properties
{
public:
        string db_attribute_name;
        string db_table_name;
        string internal_name;
        MDtype mdt;
        Attribute_Properties();
        Attribute_Properties(string);// main constructor parses string 
        Attribute_Properties(const Attribute_Properties&);
        Attribute_Properties& operator=(const Attribute_Properties&);
};
.fi
This STL map is used to provide a general way to map data from an 
external namespace to an internal one.  For example, externally
a database attribute might be referred to by the attribute
with a name like "arrival.time", but internally you 
might want to refer to this as "atime" for simplicity or 
to mesh with some other naming convention.  Bear in mind that
is is the internal name that will be needed to retrieve the
correct information from a Metadata object.  This could be 
cumbersome baggage, but it is assumed this can be hidden from
most users by defining this mapping in the global parameter
file for the application.  The Pf constructor for 
the Attribute_Map object, which is the one that that
would probably normally be used to build this, looks for 
a Tbl pf list with the key defined by the string
that is the second argument of the constructor.  This is expected
to be followed by a list of pairs of (external,internal) names.
For example, if we set the key to "Sample_Attribute_Map" we would
want an entry like this in the parameter file:
.nf
Sample_Attribute_Map &Tbl{
#internal_name	db_attribute_name	db_table_name	MDtype
sta		sta			wfdisc		string
chan		chan			wfdisc		string
wfstime		time			wfdisc		real
Ptime		time			arrival		real
Stime		time			arrival		real
wfetime		endtime			wfdisc		real
nsamp		nsamp			wfdisc		integer
samprate	samprate		wfdisc		real
wfdir		dir			wfdisc		string
wfdfile		dfile			wfdisc		string
}
.fi
Note the order of the tokens is fixed and the top row is a comment
that defines this rigid order.  Tokens are separated by standard
unix white space.  When the constructor reads this data there must
be exactly four token per line or the constructor will throw a
Metadata_error exception object (see below).  
.LP
The Attribute_Map should normally be static and defines the fixed
mapping of an internal namespace to a collection of metadata stored
in an external database.  Hence, the Attribute_Map has an intrinsic
database model for the data it is indexing.  That is, don't expect it
to be capable of defining anything that cannot be stored in an
antelope database.  If you need additional capabilities the interface
allows it, but only simple types are currently supported in the 
MDtype definition.  
.LP
Most users will wish to use the default constructor for the Attribute_Map.
The default constructor loads a file from the global pf data area
for Antelope and assumes a mapping appropriate for the css3.0 schema.
You should check the file (seispp_attribute_maps.pf) for the full
definition of namespace mapping including aliases.  That is, the
standard namespace uses Antelope-oriented naming for the internal
names (e.g. wfdisc.time for the time field in wfdisc), but it also
includes some useful aliases.  
.LP
The Attribute_Map should normally be loaded from a parameter file
early on in a programs initialization phase.  It should define the
entire namespace of parameters of interest.  The information actually
passed in and out of a program is controlled by a Metadata_list 
object.  Metadata_list objects might commonly be constructed 
using different sets of names for input and output.  These are 
easily constructed from a parameter file using the function 
pfget_mdlist defined as:
.nf
Metadata_list pfget_mdlist(Pf *pf, string pftag);
.fi
where pf is an Antelope Pf handle (see man pf(3)) and pftag is a 
string that identifies a tag to an &Tbl entry in a parameter file.
For example, to select only entries from the wfdisc table for the
example Attribute_Map defined above one could set pftag="Input_mdlist"
and place the following the the parameter file used for initialization:
.nf
Input_mdlist &Tbl{
sta		string
chan		string
wfstime		real
wfetime		real
nsamp		integer
samprate	real
wfdir		string
wfdfile		string
}  
.fi
.LP
Putting all this together,
the Attribute_Map and Metadata_list are used together in the 
database constructor;  the Attribute_Map defines the namespace
mapping from external (database centric naming) to a set of 
internal names while the Metadata_list passed to that constructor
defines what metadata to attempt to extract from the database.
The db pointer, db, is expected to be one row of a database view.
This can be a join of several tables as the table names are resolved
through the Attribute_Map.
.LP
More limited parameters can put placed in the Metadata object one
at a time with the put_metadata functions.  (There is only one
function name because C++ allows overloading.)  Single entries in
the Metadata object can be deleted with the remove function.  
In all cases the string in the function defines the key used to 
access that parameter.
.LP
Metadata are retrieved by the get_type 
functions.  The get routines will throw an exception if the requested
parameter is not found in the Metadata space.  As a result
all get functions should be surrounded by a try block with
the following catch clause:
.nf
try
{
	series of metadata get requests
}
catch ( Metadata_error& me)
{
	me.log_error();
	error handling code
}
.fi
The catch block can handle this error appropriately as some
metadata requests require different actions.  
As in all proper error handlers the program can abort, set
a default and try to continue, or something else.  
.LP
A copy constructor and an assignment operator are provided to
allow depositing Metadata objects into STL containers.  
An output function is supplied through the "<<" friend function.
A corresponding input function was intentionally not included in
the class definition.  
.SH FILES
.LP
A defaults parameter file must be found in the PFPATH 
or a program using this library will die immediately.  
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.LP
METADATA_DEFAULTS can be used to redefine the name for the defaults
parameter file.  If it is null the default of "metadata_defaults" is
used.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.IP (1)
The dark side of the generality is some loss of efficiency and 
bloated memory usage because in this implementation all metadata
are stored as strings in an Antelope pf structure.  
.IP (2)
The Attribute_Map object adds complexity to something that is already
a bit messy. Applications using these functions should strive to hide
this element of the implementation from normal use.  In most cases this
is expected to mean you will build a static Attribute_Map pf description
for all programs using this library and a particular database 
schema.  In the same way the mdlist can and should be prepared in
standard pf file for a program, placed in the standard Antelope location
for pf files, and not be advertised to the user.
