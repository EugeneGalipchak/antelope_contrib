.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
A number of types of data can be called a time series.  The common
concept to all time series objects is that a time series is a special
way to represent a function of one independent variable.  
The "special" part is that the function being represented numerically 
by a time series object 
is being approximated by the values of the function defined
on a regular, one-dimensional mesh of the
independent variable. A regular
mesh in one dimension is completely described by only two parameters:  
(1) the value of the independent variable (time) at the first sample 
of the actual data (the \fIt0\fR variable in the Basic_Time_Series 
object definition), and (2) the sample interval (the \fIdt\fR variable
in the Basic_Time_Series definition).  I use the t label on both of these
parameters since the independent variable is commonly viewed as a time 
variable.  The user should recognize, however, that the concept is 
broader than data sampled by time alone and the most general definition
is any physical quantity sampled at regular intervals.
.LP
The Basic_Time_Series is a base concept from which specific types of
actual time series data can be viewed as a derived class.  The
reason this is useful is that the data for a particular time series
type can thought of as a generalized vector of sample values.
Inheritance provides a natural way to encapsulate and isolate this
base concept from variations for special data types.  Two derived classes from
Basic_Time_Series can be found in the seispp library that illustrate
this idea:  (1)  the Time_Series object (man 3) defines a scalar valued
time series, and (2) the Three_Component_Seismogram (man 3) object 
defines a special seismology time series for three-components of 
ground motion.  Note that others similar data objects that
could be derived from a Basic_Time_Series are complex valued time
series (see example below) or an n-vector time series.  
.LP
This base class adds a few special parameters and functions that
I viewed as a fundamental concept for all time series data that
are either essential or useful depending on the context.
The \fIlive\fR variable is used for simple logical tests to mark data 
as valid or dead. As the name suggests a constructor should set this variable
true if construction of valid data is successful.  Conversely an application
can mark a serious data problem by setting this field false to mark the
contents as all bad.

The \fItref\fR variable is switch (enum) that can take on
only one of two values:  "absolute" or "relative".  To be
more precise, here is the definition:
.nf
.in 2c
enum Time_Reference_Type {absolute,relative};
.fi
.LP
This allows absolute time reference frames (commonly called epoch times
in seismology) or relative time sampling in which the user should assume
the application has it's own internal concept of a time reference.
.LP
The functions \fIis_gap, add_gap\fR, and \fIzero_gaps\fR
are used to handle data gaps.  \fIis_gap\fR checks for gaps
at a specified sample number (the int version) or by 
time (the overloaded double version) returning true if
the sample/time is a gap.  The \fIzero_gaps\fR function
sets the data for all times marked as a gap to zero.
It is a pure virtual function as the definition zero 
depends upon the actual data in the vector of samples that
define the actual time series to be represented.  
Since Basic_Time_Series is a base class this concept is
rational, but the basic idea may seem strange to a newcomer.
.LP
Note that the interface hides the details of the gap implementation.
The user should assume that areas marked as gaps can be zeroed
without loss of information and that the problem of marking
output data as a gap is to be solved differently.  That is,
defining gaps in an external representation of the data is
a different problem (see trgaps(3) for a discourse on this
subject and a general solution).  
Derived classes must be conscious of this problem in 
building constructors and in producing output functions that
preserve gap information.
.LP
Finally, this, the base class, includes two inline functions
called \fItime\fR and \fIsample_number\fR.
The \fItime\fR function returns the time (independent variable)
associated with sample number i and \fIsample_time\fR does the
inverse (i.e. returns sample index associated with a given time.).
.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
A Basic_Time_Series is pretty much a pure virtual base class.  Here
is an example of a bare bones implementation of a complex time
series object:
.nf
.in 2c
class Complex_Time_Series : public Basic_Time_Series
{
public:
	// complex data samples stored in an STL vector object
	vector<complex> y; 
	// a few basic constructors
	Complex_Time_Series(){y.reserve(0);};
	Complex_Time_Series(int nsamp){y.reserve(nsamp)};
};
.fi
.LP
Note that by inheritance the dt, t0, etc. of the Basic_Time_Series
become members of the derived Complex_Time_Series object.
.SH EXCEPTIONS
.LP
None of the member functions of a Basic_Time_Series will throw an 
exception.  
One can assume any useful derived class will potentially throw 
a number of possible exceptions.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
The Basic_Time_Series object is not very useful by itself and exists
primarily as a base class from which useful data objects can be 
derived. 
Those not familiar with inheritance in object oriented program 
might consult books on the subject before questioning the 
wisdom of this definition.
