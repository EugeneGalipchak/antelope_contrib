.SH NAME
SeisppError - error object for seispp library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include "SeisppError.h"
using namespace SEISPP;
class SeisppError;
class SeisppDberror : public SeisppError;
class SACdataError : public SeisppError;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The seispp library is an object-oriented seismic processing
library written in C++.  One of the things C++ added to 
plain C is exceptions as a mechanism for library routines
to handle problems.  For Antelope users the SeisppError
facility is comparable to the elog library in Antelope, but
with an object oriented flavor.  
.LP
The present facility is pretty basic with the 
base class SeisppError object being defined as follows:
.nf
.in 2c
class SeisppError
{
public:
        string message;
        SeisppError(){message="seispp library error\\n";};
        SeisppError(const string mess){message=mess;};
        virtual void log_error(){cerr << "seispp error: "<<message<<endl;};
};
.fi
.LP
That is, a SeisppError is little more than a fancy way to return
an error message through the string variable "message".  
The simple function "log_error" is used to post that message to
the unix standard error stream.  
.LP
The concept here is that more complicated error returns would
be derived by inheritance from a SeisppError object.  The 
\fISACdataError\fR object is an example.  It's actual
definition is:
.nf 
.in 2c
class SACdataError : public SeisppError
{
public:
        SACdataError(const string mess){message=mess;};
        virtual void log_error()
        {
                cerr<<"Error processing SAC format time series"<<endl;
                cerr<<"Error message = "<<message;
        }
};
.fi
.LP
Hence the only major difference between a SACdataError and 
the base class SeisppError is that the SACdataError 
log_error function adds an addition qualifier to the error
message that is posted.  
.LP
The \fISeisppDberror\fR is similar except it has
the constructor defined as SeisppError(string,DatabaseHandle).  
It prints a special message with log_error that can be used
for debugging problems.
.LP
Users of this library can and should build their own derived
classes from SeisppError.  If more information is needed to
handle different errors differently, this can be done using
inheritance from SeisppError as in the examples above.  
e.g.  an integer error code
is easily placed in a derived object like SACdataError 
and a handler can be built around a switch-case on the
error return code (a standard plain C method).  
For the time being this library is written with the concept
that when an exception is thrown an operation failed and
there is no mixed case.  i.e. some errors can be treated
differently than others.  If you need that facility 
and are building on this library build a new error 
class to support it.

.LP
Expect this class of error objects to expand.  For now assume
that seispp library functions will only throw a SeisppError 
exception and you have to depend on the documentation of a function
to know how to handle any exception.
