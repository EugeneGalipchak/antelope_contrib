perlseisparams 
=======================

The stuff here was basically created using h2xs:
h2xs -O -n gis_helper -x /path/to/header/file.h

Of course some fixes had to be applied (altough the -x switch already produced most of the code):

-Makefile.PL was replaced by Makefile.PL.proto 
-runmake.sh was added to avoid confusion between makefile and Makefile
-makefile was added to simplify the usage of antelopeish Makestuff 

the .pm needed editing 
the .xs needed serious editing

test.pl was more or less ignored

USAGE:
make
make install
make clean

other stuff like make test was intentionally never tested and should NOT work...

the file MANIFEST was left untouched, which is fine so far...


The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.
