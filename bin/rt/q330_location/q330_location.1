.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBq330_location\fP extracts q330 /pf/st files from an orb, finds the current lat and long 
provided by the gps clock at each station, and compares the values to those in the 
site and dlsite table.  
There is a difference greater than \fImax_offset_meters\fP from the stated values in the 
database and the current gps reading. 
This program exits after reading each selected /pf/st file once.
This program is designed to run as a cron program under rtexec.pf.
