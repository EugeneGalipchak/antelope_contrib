2003.017: version 1.4
	- Included OpenBSD versions of strlcpy() and strlcat() for
	  portability to Linux.

2002.066: version 1.3
	- Added explicit string initialization, so as not to assume
	  that the compiler does this for us.
	- Added more resetting to the substitution string so as not
	  to print junk when no substitution was actually done.

2001.353:
	- Changed the call to orbreap_nd() to orbreap() and re-fitted
	  things such that the program is now data driven.
	- Removed the '-nowait' option.  The logic is different using
	  a blocking call to orbreap(). (and I never used the option)
	- Added the option '-state' to make use of a state file for
	  saving/restoring the ORB position.

2001.3??:
	Added the ability to extract fields in database rows that are in
	parameter file packets; such as is found in /pf/orbmag packets.
	These substitutions are indicated with '@' delimeters, i.e. 
	a substitution indicated with @origin.evid@ will look in a
	parameter file packet for an origin table database row and
	substitute with the 'evid' field of that row.
