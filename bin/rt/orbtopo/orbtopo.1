.TH ORBTOPO 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
orbtopo \- Create topology plots of orb interconnectivity
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
orbtopo dbname targetdir
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The orbtopo program monitors a Datascope database in registry1.2 or higher format, 
which should contain monitoring results from the pforbstat(1) program archived by 
the orbpf2db(1) program. The orbtopo program updates a set of graphs in the target-directory
showing current orb connectivity. If a state file is enabled and new orbs appear since 
the last run, orbtopo emails recipients specified in the parameter file about the changes. The 
orbtopo program is meant to run as a cron job, usually from the Antelope rtexec(1) crontab table 
in rtexec.pf.

.SH LIBRARY
The orbtopo program requires the Python NetworkX and PyGraphviz packages to be installed from 
http://networkx.lanl.gov

orbtopo will process database tables with non-routable IP addresses in them. However, there is an 
assumption that no non-routable address appears more than once across the entire set of orbservers
being monitored.
