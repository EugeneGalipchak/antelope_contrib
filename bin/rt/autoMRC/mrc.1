.SH NAME
mrc \- automatically send mass re-centerring (MRC) command to a DAS     
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

mrc [ -m srcmatch] 
    [-p parameter-file]
    [-s sleep]
    [-t tperiod ]
    [-V verbatum ] 
    [-v max_lta] 
    orbname dc_name

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmrc\fP reads data from the orb buffer \fIorbname\fR; calculates LTA
for each DAS ( all DAS component) in a system and if LTA exceeds 
certain maximum value
\fBmrc\fP sends a \fB'RCRC'\fP command to the problem DAS through
\fIdc_out\fR. \fIdc_out\fR usually specifies the IP address of the DC via
which an MRC can be send to a DAS.
\fBmrc\fP requires a parameter file
which contains all existing in RT system DAS IDs - \fIparameter-file\fR 
(\fIpkt.pf\fR is default) .

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-m srcmatch"
Only packets which match the regular expression \fIsrcmatch\fR
will be requested from the \fIorbname\fR. By default \fBmrc\fP reads 1s/s data.  
.IP "-p parameter-file"
A parameter file \fIparameter-file\fR
will be used to select all possible DAS IDs in a RT system.
A \fBpkt.pf\fP parameter file is used by default.  
.IP "-s sleep"
\fBmrc\fP sends an MRC to the problem DAS twice at 
a certain time interval, which can be specified in a command line with 
a \fIsleep\fR option in units of seconds. The default value is 30 seconds.
.IP "-t tperiod "
\fBmrc\fP calculates LTA for a certain time period, which can be set by 
a \fItperiod\fR option in units of seconds. 
Default value is 3600 seconds.
.IP "-V verbatim"
Save command buffer in a \fIverbatim\fR file before sending it to DAS.
.IP "-v max_lta"
\fBmrc\fP sends an MRC to the DAS only when calculated
absolute value of an LTA is exceeds certain value. 
This value can be specified in a command line
with \fImax_lta\fR option in units of counts. The default value is 100000.

.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
Send an MRC with  the following options :

.nf
	- LTA max value can't exceed  50000 counts;
	- LTA time period will be 4 hours;
	- use CBB1S type of data to calculate LTA ;
	- read data from ORB on localhost ;
	- send command via the DC port on IP address 132.239.4.194.


	mrc  -v 50000 -t 14400 -m ".*/CBBA1S" localhost 132.239.4.194
