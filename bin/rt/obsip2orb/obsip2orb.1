.SH NAME
obsip2orb \- Send OBSIP waveform data to orb
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBobsip2orb\fP [-v] [-X] [-n] [-c orbclient]
                \fIorb dbin [dbin2 [dbin3 ...]]\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBobsip2orb\fP will send all miniseed data in the wfdisc file of \fIdbin\fP into \fIorb\fP 
using miniseed2orb.  The program opens the wfdisc, selects datatype of "sd", 
does a unique sort on wfdisc dir-dfile fields, 
then sorts by station-channel-time before sending the data to the orb.

There are two checks which are made before data are sent to the orb.  The first check is 
to see if \fIorb\fP is allowing connections.  The second check is to see if the
orbclient (usually orbmsd2days or orb2orb) that will read the miniseed packets is connected.  
This is required to make sure that the data are not written to the orb to quickly.

\fBobsip2orb\fP will write a temporary local \fIminiseed2orb_obsip.pf\fP file that is 
used to control the \fBminiseed2orb\fP instance. 

.IP \fIorb\fP 
orb to send data to.
.IP \fIdbin\fP 
database which needs waveforms to be send to orb.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
verbose
.IP -n
Does not send any data, only shows commands which would have been executed.
.IP "-c orbclient"
Orbclient which will read mseed data packets from orb.  Default is orbclient is orbmsd2days.
.IP -X
Expert mode.  This removes the throttling of \fBminiseed2orb\fP.  Use of this option requires 
a complete understanding of the end-to-end dataflow and buffering.  It is extremely easy to lose 
data in this mode.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
needs to have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh.  
.SH RETURN VALUES
0 if successful, 1 if not.
