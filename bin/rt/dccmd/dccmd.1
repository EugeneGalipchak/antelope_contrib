.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdccmd\fP sends commands DASes or DC itself through
\fIoutput\fR, which usually specifies the IP address of the DC.
\fBdccmd\fP may require two parameter files.
One contains all existing in RT system DAS IDs - \fIparameter-file\fR 
(\fIpkt.pf\fR is default) and the second one contains command parameters for
a "mass re-centering" (MRC) command - \fImrcpar-file\fR ( \fIdccmd.pf\fR is default ).

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-D dasid"
Send an "reset-DAS"command  to a das with a \fIdasid\fR number.
.IP "-R "
Send 'DC RESET' command to specified DC.
.IP "-d dasid"
Send an MRC  only to a das with a \fIdasid\fR number.
By default send command to all DASes which exist in RT system.
.IP "-o mrcpar-file"
A parameter file \fImrcpar-file\fR
will be used to select all constants for an MRC  command, such as
number of times to repeat command, timeout between command send to one das, 
timeout between command send to different dases, etc.
A \fBdccmd.pf\fP parameter file is used by default.  
.IP "-p parameter-file"
A parameter file \fIparameter-file\fR
will be used to select all possible DAS IDs in a RT system.
A \fBpkt.pf\fP parameter file is used by default.  
.IP "-s staname"
Send an MRC  only to a station with a \fIstaname\fR name.
By default send command to all DASes which exist in RT system.
.IP "-t timeout "
This option is valid only for a socket connection and specifies the number of
seconds to wait for data on a connected socket before closing the socket and 
opening a new connection. Default value is 5 seconds.
.IP "-v"
Be more verbose.
.IP "start-time window"
Specifies a time range of the \fIdccmd\fR process to be active.
