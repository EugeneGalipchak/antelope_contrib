.TH ISI2ORB 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
isi2orb \- Acquire data from the IDA Systems Interface into an orbserver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
isi2orb [-vV] [-p pfname] server orbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBisi2orb\fP acquires continuous waveform data from one or more stations
in the International Deployment of Accelerometers (IDA), via the IDA 
Systems Interface (ISI). An Antelope parameter-file controls the streams to be 
imported; wildcards are supported. 

The \fIserver\fP argument on the command line must specify the IDA 
server compliant with the implemented version of the IDA Systems Interface
(ISI) toolkit. The \fIorbname\fP parameter gives the name of an 
Antelope orbserver to which continuous data should be written. 

Further detail on the parameter file contents, which identify the 
continuous waveform data streams to import, is given in the PARAMETER 
FILE section of the man page below. An alternate parameter-file may be 
given via the -p option on the command line.

The \fIcalib\fP and \fIcalper\fP values for the stations being acquired
are derived from an ISI configuration report requested from the server 
at startup. If the stations being acquired are not present in that
configuration report (a situation which will hopefully not occur), 
the \fIcalib\fP and \fIcalper\fP values are set to null defaults of 
0.0 and -1.0, respectively. 

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-p pfname" 
Specify a parameter file other than the default \fIisi2orb.pf\fP.

.SH FILES
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.IP net
This is the SEED network code, usually \fIII\fP, to use for the orb 
source-names for the packets. 
.IP streams
This parameter holds a table of ISI-style stream expressions. These are of
the form \fIsta.chn.loc\fP where one or more of those may optionally be 
an asterisk character, indicating a wildcard. (The legacy mode of placing
many such triplets together separated by plus-signs (\fI+\fP) is supported
as well, though not encouraged due to the potential to make a hard-to-read
parameter file). 
.IP uppercase
This parameter specifies whether to convert station, channel, and loc
codes to uppercase before creating the orbserver source-names. 
.IP segtype
This parameter specifies the segtype value to use in orb waveform packets 
for the converted data. 
.IP isi_logging
This parameter sets the logging mode of the ISI libraries. If set to 
\fIstdout\fP or \fIstderr\fP, the respective Unix output stream will be 
used. If set to \fIelog\fP, logging will be redirected to the Antelope 
elog(3) facility.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
In verbose mode, \fBisi2orb\fP announces the program start time, announces the 
actual data request string sent
to the server, then announces every station-channel as it is first seen in the 
incoming data stream. In very verbose mode, \fBisi2orb\fP will also 
emit the configuration report requested from the server on startup, the 
fully detailed data request, and summary metadata for each acquired packet.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The ida2orb(1) program is deprecated and has been completely replaced 
by this program. 

The \fIisi_logging\fP parameter affects only the disposition of notification 
messages from within the ISI toolkit library (libisi(3)) itself, 
not the logging from the main \fBisi2orb\fP program (which always goes through
the Antelope logging mechanism) or the output of the initial reports 
in veryverbose (-V) mode (which always go to Unix standard-out).
