.SH NAME
rtxcor - real time picker for teleseismic P waves using cross-correlation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
rtxcor dbtmp [-pf pffile]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program estimates arrival times from teleseismic P waves using waveform
data alone.  It is designed for use in a real-time environment under control
of orbassoc(1).  It is designed to be normally executed as a step in perl scripts that
drive real time event processing for teleseismic events.  It can, however, be
used as an element of a processing script to process a complete database of 
teleseismic events automatically.  If you try this, however, be aware that the
dbtmp database is blindly assumed to contain a origin, assoc, and arrival
tables for one and only one origin.  This constraint is imposed by the
way orbassoc interacts with auxiliary processing scripts like that used to
drive this program (see rundbgenloc(1) and runrtxcor(1)).
.LP
The processing algorithm used by rtxcor is the same as that used in dbxcor(1).
The primary difference is that dbxcor has a graphical user interface to set
three key variables that are fixed or determined automatically in rtxcor.
These are:  (1) the time window used to define the beam (stack) used for
cross-correlation; (2) the robust time window (used to compute weights
from the robust loss function used in this algorithm); and (3) the reference
trace used as the initial seed for cross-correlations.  (see dbxcor(1) and
the online documentation for the processing object found at:

.SH OPTIONS
\fBpffile\fR is an alternative parameter file to use instead of the default.
Although available this option is only useful if this program is used in
a shell-script driven batch procedure.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.LP
Because rtxcor is a simplified version of dbxcor(1), it shares many of
the same parameters as dbxcor.  A simple rule is any dbxcor parameter not
related to graphics will be required by rtxcor.  There are, however, 
several new parameters used by rtxcor that are not needed by dbxcor.
This section describes only those parameters.  
.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
This section will eventually contain a sample orbassoc pf that implements
this algorithm in a real time environment.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
The environment under which this operates (under orbassoc's control)
can make it difficult
to track a failure of the program.
