Installation instructions for libslink: the SeedLink client library.

-- Building --

Unix/Linux: The easiest way to compile the library is to simply run
'make'.  The included Makefile should work for most Unix-like
environments with GNU's gcc.  The Makefile will need to be edited to
use a different compiler (e.g. the Sun compiler), instructions are
included in the Makefile.  By default a statically linked version of
the library is built 'libslink.a'.  Using gcc it is possible to build
a shared library with 'make shared'.

Windows: On a WIN32 platform the library can be compiled by using the
Nmake compatible Makefile.win (e.g. 'nmake -f Makefile.win') or Open
Watcom's Wmake with Makefile.wat (e.g. 'wmake -f Makefile.wat'). The
default target is a static library 'libslink.lib'.  The library has
been tested with Microsoft Visual Studio 6 and Open Watcom 1.1.

For non-WIN32 platforms the POSIX nanosleep() function is used.  This
function may not be implemented on older Solaris or Linux platforms.
It is known to be available under Solaris 8 or later and recent
versions of Glibc2.

-- Installing --

For installation into the system development environment simply copy
the library (libslink.a and/or libslink.so) into a system library
directory and copy the associated libslink.h into a system include
directory.  Otherwise the library and include file can be used
directly from the build directory.

The 'example' directory includes an example SeedLink client that uses
libslink.

The 'doc' directory includes all associated documentation including
a Users Guide and man pages for library functions.

-- Threading --

The library is thread-safe under Unix-like environments with the
condition that each connection descriptor (SLCD) is handled by a
single thread.  Thread independent logging schemes are possible.
Under WIN32 the library is not thread-safe.

-- Pronounciation --

lib = 'l' + [eye] + 'b'  (as in library, long 'i')
s = [es]   (like the beginning of 'esta' in como esta?)
link = link   (rhymes with the color pink)

all together: 'l' [eye] 'b' [es] link
