.SH NAME
mseed2seedpkt \- Create SEED type ORB packets from ORB packets that
contain Mini-SEED records
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
mseed2seedpkt [-v] [-d database] [-m match] [-r reject]
              [-n number] [-s pktid|time] [-S statefile[:pkts]]
              [-o offset] \fIin\fP \fIout\fP

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmseed2seedpkt\fP connects to an input ORB, \fIin\fR, collects
packets which should include Mini-SEED records, reformats them into
SEED type ORB packets and sends them to an output ORB, \fIout\fP.

The incoming packets should include a Mini-SEED record at \fIoffset\fP
bytes into the raw ORB packet.  The Mini-SEED records must include a
Blockette 1000 which correctly specifies the record length.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-v"
Be more verbose.  This flag can be used multiple times ("-v -v" or 
"-vv") for more verbosity.

.IP "-d \fIdatabase\fR"
Copy calib, calper and segtype from the calibration table in the
specified database.  Recommended if the data will be processed
directly from the ORB since this information is not available in the
data stream.  Channel names that are processed will be inserted into
this database, if not specified a local foreignkeys database will be
used.

.IP "-m \fImatch\fR"
.IP "-r \fIreject\fR"
Only select packets which match the regular expression \fImatch\fP and
do not match the regular expression \fIreject\fP.

.IP "-n \fInumber\fR"
Only process \fInumber\fP packets, quiting afterwards.  Default is to
processing an infinite number of packets.

.IP "-s \fIpktid|time\fR"
Specifiy the starting position in the input ORB as either a packet ID
or a time.  If the argument is all digits it is assumed to be a packet
ID otherwise a time string.

.IP "-S \fIstatefile[:packets]\fR"
If a \fIstatefile\fR is specified, the time and packet ID of the last
packet processed will be saved to \fIstatefile\fP during program
shutdown.  Upon startup this information is used to reposition the
input ORB to the next packet.  A number of \fIpackets\fP can also be
specified, the state information will be saved everytime this many
packets has been received.  This helps minimize the amount of
redundant packets processed in the case of catastrophic failure.

.IP "-o \fIoffset\fP"
This option specifies the offset in bytes in received ORB packets at
which to find a Mini-SEED record.  The default is 8 bytes.

.IP "\fIin\fR"
A required argument.  Specifies the input ORB in [host]:port format.
If 'host' is omitted 'localhost' is assumed.

.IP "\fIout\fR"
A required argument.  Specifies the output ORB in [host]:port format.
If 'host' is omitted 'localhost' is assumed.

.SH "NOTES"
This program will not search the ORB packet for a Mini-SEED record,
the user must know, a priori, the offset into the packet to find the
record.  Of course, with a little experimentation it is easy to
discover what the offset for a given packet should be.
