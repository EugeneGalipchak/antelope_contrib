mseed2seedpkt:

This is a Antelope ORB module that will read selected packets, look
for a Mini-SEED record at a specified offset into the packets, and,
if a record was found, re-package the record as a SEED type ORB packet.
Optionally a database can be specified from which calibration information
(calib, calper and segtype) is read that will be inserted into the SEED
type packets.

The SEED records in input packets must include a 1000 Blockette which
correctly specifies it's length.

The intention of this module is to convert ORB packets that include
Mini-SEED records but are not standard packets into something that is
usable by the rest of the system and downstream systems.
