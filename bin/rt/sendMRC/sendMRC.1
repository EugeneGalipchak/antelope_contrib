.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsendMRC\fP routinely sends an \fBMRC\fP command to DASes through
\fIoutput\fR, which usually specifies the IP address of the DC.
\fBsendMRC\fP may require two parameter files.
One contains all DAS IDs existing in the RT system - \fIparameter-file\fR 
(\fIpkt.pf\fR is default) and the second one contains command parameters -
\fImrcpar-file\fR ( \fImcr.pf\fR is default ).

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-d dasid"
Send an MRC  only to a das with a \fIdasid\fR number.
By default send command to all DASes which exist in RT system.
.IP "-o mrcpar-file"
A parameter file \fImrcpar-file\fR
will be used to select all constants for an MRC  command, such as
number of times to repeat command, timeout between commands sent to one das, 
timeout between command send to different dases, etc.
A \fBmrc.pf\fP parameter file is used by default.  
.IP "-p parameter-file"
A parameter file \fIparameter-file\fR
will be used to select all possible DAS IDs in a RT system.
A \fBpkt.pf\fP parameter file is used by default.  
.IP "-s staname"
Send an MRC  only to a station with a \fIstaname\fR name.
By default send command to all DASes which exist in RT system.
.IP "-R "
Send 'DC RESET' command to specified DC.
.IP "-t timeout "
This option is valid only for a socket connection and specifies the number of
seconds to wait for data on a connected socket before closing the socket and 
opening a new connection. Default value is 5 seconds.
.IP "-V verbatim"
Save command buffer in a \fIverbatim\fR file before sending it to DAS.
.IP "-v"
Be more verbose.
.IP "start-time window"
Specifies a time range of the \fIsendMRC\fR process to be active.
