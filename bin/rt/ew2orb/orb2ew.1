.SH NAME
orb2ew \- Export waveform data from an orb to Earthworm
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBorb2ew \fP[-p \fIpfname\fP] \fIorb\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBorb2ew\fP module provides one or more Earthworm export_generic style
server instances, to which import clients can connect to request data.

The module
is multithreaded, meaning that one instance can export data on several
ports at once. The module is also dynamically reconfigurable,
which means that changes to the parameter file are monitored and
noticed automatically. There should be no need to stop and restart the program
after  removing an old server or adding a new one.

The \fIorb\fP name from which to read data is specified on the command line. After
that, most of the \fBorb2ew\fP configuration is in the \fBorb2ew\fP parameter file,
named \fBorb2ew\fP.pf by default. 

A sample parameter file is included below. The parameter
program_loglevel controls the overall level of logging output for the
program. The options for this setting are "quiet", "verbose", and
"veryverbose". The latter is meant for debugging purposes, and will
generate a great deal of output (several lines for each incoming
packet).

The bulk of the parameter file is contained in the 'export_servers' array.
This array in turn contains one array for each data-export server
desired. Each one of these export servers must have a name, which is
used to group the parameters for that connection in the export_servers
array. This name may be chosen at user discretion (usually as a useful
mnemonic for the particular data connection). The name will be used in
a number of places throughout the program when labeling output messages.

Before describing in detail the contents of each export_servers subarray,
we should note the 'defaults' array in the parameter file. This array
specifies the default parameters for Earthworm export connections.
If one of the parameters does not show up in the subarray describing
a particular connection, the value from the defaults array is used. Values in the
specific subarrays for each connection will override the defaults. A
description of the connection parameters follows:

.IP server_ipaddress
This gives the IP address of the Earthworm server from which to export data.
The default is to leave this blank, in which case all network interfaces 
on the machine are valid for connections. On a multi-homed host, users 
may wish to restrict the outgoing IP addresses on which connections will 
be accepted. This is accomplished by specifying the IP address (in 
a.b.c.d dotted-decimal notation) of the desired network interface.

.IP server_port
This is the TCP port-number on which a server thread is is serving data.

.IP send_heartbeat_sec
The \fBorb2ew\fP import module exchanges heartbeats with the remote import
module at regular intervals. This parameter specifies the interval, in seconds,
at which these heartbeats are sent by \fBorb2ew\fP.

.IP send_heartbeat_string
The heartbeat sent out by \fBorb2ew\fP must be a string which matches the
value being expected by the remote import module.

.IP expect_heartbeat_sec
This parameter describes, in seconds, how often to expect an incoming
heartbeat from the remote import module. Usually this value is set to
an amount of time notably longer than the actual import heartbeat interval,
to avoid unnecessary warning messages. If \fBorb2ew\fP does not receive
a heartbeat within this interval, it will issue a warning message and
continue.

.IP export_heartbeat_string
This parameter is a regular expression (in the style of regex(5))
which the incoming heartbeat string must match.

.IP select
This parameter is a string which is fed to the orbselect(3) call
after each orb connection is established. If the parameter is left 
blank, no orbselect(3) call is made. 

.IP reject
This parameter is a string which is fed to the orbreject(3) call
after each orb connection is established. If the parameter is left 
blank, no orbreject(3) call is made. 

.IP starttime
This parameter specifies a beginning time for data which should be 
sent. If the string is blank, no time filtering is done. If the string 
is specified in a format understood by str2epoch(3), the orbafter(3) routine
will be called to position the orbserver read pointer, and packets 
before the specified time will be rejected. This parameter may also be used
to rewind the server to start at an earlier position in the orb.

.IP my_inst
This is the Earthworm institution code for \fBorb2ew\fP to report itself
as when it sends out heartbeats. This institution code is translated
to an integer value by \fBorb2ew\fP, according to the contents of the
earthworm.pf parameter file (For more details, see the man page earthworm(5)).

.IP my_mod
This is the Earthworm module id number for \fBorb2ew\fP to report itself
as when it sends out heartbeats. This module code is translated
to an integer value by \fBorb2ew\fP, according to the contents of the
earthworm.pf parameter file (For more details, see the man page earthworm(5)).

.IP loglevel
This the level of logging information for the export thread in
question to put out. The allowed values are "quiet", "verbose", and
"veryverbose". If this option is not specified, it defaults to the
value of program_loglevel. As with the other parameters, this can
be changed dynamically, which can be useful to turn on veryverbose output
for a connection on which the operator has a question, then turn
off veryverbose output after resolution.

.IP select
Outgoing stations (orb source-names, i.e. net_sta_chan, before they're
translated to any new names) which match this regular expression will
be allowed to go out to the remote Earthworm module. The default, which
is to leave this blank, allows all sources on the orb to go out.

.IP reject
Outgoing stations (orb source-names, i.e. net_sta_chan, before they're
translated to any new names) which match this regular expression will
be rejected and not allowed to go out over the export connection. The default,
which is to leave this blank, allows all sources on the orb to go out.

.IP pins
The pins array specifies optional Earthworm pin-numbers for individual station
channels. Each entry should be listed as NET_STA_CHAN followed by 
the desired pin number. If no pin number is specified for a given 
channel, a pin-number of 0 will be used. 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-p pfname"
Specify an alternate parameter-file name for the \fIorb\fP to earthworm module.
The default parameter file is "\fBorb2ew\fP.pf".

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"

\fBorb2ew\fP and ew2orb replace the eworm2orb and orb2eworm programs, which
are deprecated.

The translations of earthworm logo fields (institute, module, and type)
are set when first encountered and do not update even when the
underlying earthworm.pf parameter file changes. If changes are made
to these translations, the program must be restarted for them to be
recognized. Also, despite being specified in the earthworm.pf parameter
file, the INST_WILDCARD, MOD_WILDCARD, and TYPE_WILDCARD values are
hard-wired to zero as per Earthworm definition. The exception is if
one of the earthworm-logo numbers is not found and continually
shows up as, e.g., MOD_165. In this case the earthworm.pf parameter
file is checked upon each translation. Note that this can introduce
a small run-time inefficiency; it's advantageous to have translations
present in earthworm.pf for all modules, message types, and installations
encountered.
