.SH NAME
dbadd_unassoc \- Add unassociated events from a catalog to a real-time database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
dbadd_unassoc [-l seconds] [-n] [-s catalog_subset_expression] dbcat dbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
dbadd_unassoc is a companion to dbassoc_rt. Whereas dbassoc_rt looks in a catalog
for hypocenters that associate with arrivals in the target database, dbadd_unassoc
looks in a catalog for hypocenters that do not correspond to any of the events 
in the target database. The presumption is that dbassoc_rt has been run first, and 
has identified all the catalog events that associate with events in the existing 
catalog. The primary value of this is to put into the target database a note about
earthquakes that were reported by other institutions or processes and "should 
have been seen" in the target database. The catalog_subset_expression specified
with the -s option hopefully characterizes events in the catalog which should 
have been seen, for example with the grn() function of dbexpressions(5) or other 
strategy. The database resulting from the target database (probably from a 
real-time system), from the following dbassoc_rt process, and from the following 
dbadd_unassoc process should be a valuable diagnostic tool for system performance, 
system cross-comparison, and integration of multiple regional and national 
location systems. 


	Pending further insight, one must specify a lag-time after which 
dbadd_unassoc has given up on the real-time system and is willing to add the 
listed event [based on origin time and lddate]. Unfortunately this switches
from a data-driven model to a process-synchronization model, which is not
desirable in an asynchronous processing system. 
.SH OPTIONS
-l seconds how long to wait after real-time to decide that a catalog hypocenter
was 'missed' and to add it

-n exit after the catalog database has been initially processed. Otherwise, 
wait indefinitely for new hypocenters to appear in the catalog database. 

-s catalog_subset_expression Only include catalog hypocenters that match this 
expression

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Aside from the process-synchronization problems of the -l option mentioned 
above, dbadd_unassoc could probably be better handled as an additional task
within dbassoc_rt, perhaps checking "missed" hypocenters agaist the detections 
in a real-time database instead of just the associated arrivals [Suggested 
by Frank Vernon].

	Since the dbloc2 analysis which may follow on this database requires 
at least some pick information to recognize that there is a "next event" at a 
certain time, there perhaps should be a -p option that will add a predicted 
phase of +P from the listed hypocenter at the closest station. As an
alternative to adding predicted phases, dbadd_unassoc should look for 
real phases in the catalog database and add them instead. In addition to helping 
an analyst get to the event with dbloc2, having phases present would hopefully 
prevent separate evids for the same event if more than one external catalog 
sees an event missed by the real-time system.
