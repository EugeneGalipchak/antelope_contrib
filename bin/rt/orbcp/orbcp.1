.SH NAME
orbcp \- orb copy program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

orbcp {-orbin in_orbname | -filein in_filename} [-src srcexpr]
      [-orbout out_orbname] [-fileout out_filename] [-reverse]
      [-repeat] [-npackets npackets] [-sim_latency sim_latency]

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
orbcp is a program for copying packets from one orb to another.
It also can copy from/to a plain disk file. When copying to
a plain disk file, the file is a raw image of the data stream
and can be used later as simulated input. When copying from
a plain disk file, the input time stamps can be offset to 
simulate a near real time data stream.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-orbin in_orbname | -filein in_filename"
Name of input orbserver or a plain input disk file. One
and only one of these must be specified.
.IP "-src srcexpr"
A source expression string. This is used to sift the types of packets
for copying. If this is not specified, then all packet types are
copied. This is only used when copying from an input orbserver.
.IP "-orbout out_orbname"
Name of output orbserver.
.IP "-fileout out_filename"
Name of output plain disk file.
.IP "-reverse"
If this flag is specified, then the time values and pakcet sizes
are byte reversed upon reading and/or writing to/from plain
disk files. This has no effect on the orbserver connections.
.IP "-repeat"
If this flag is specified and the input is a plain disk file,
then the input file is reread upon EOF indefinitely to provide
a continuous data source. Every time the file is rewinded, the
subsequent packet times are offset to preserve a monotonic
time stream.
.IP "-npackets npackets"
A total packet count for copying. orbcp will exit when this
count is reached. If not specified, then orbcp will execute
indefinitely.
.IP "-sim_latency sim_latency"
A simulation time latency in seconds. If this is specified and
the input is from a plain disk file, then orbcp will attempt
to further offset the time values to be close to sim_latency
seconds behind real time.
