.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

      [-ircnt] [-orcnt] [-pktstart pktid]
      [-rcnt_time minutes] [-npackets npackets]

.SH DESCRIPTION
orbcp is a program for copying packets from one orb to another.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-orbin in_orbname"
Name of input orbserver. This argument is required.
.IP "-orbout out_orbname"
Name of output orbserver. This argument is required.
.IP "-src srcexpr"
A source expression string. This is used to sift the types of packets
for copying. If this is not specified, then all packet types are
copied.
.IP "-ircnt"
Input reconnect flag. If this is specified, then orbcp will
attempt to reconnect to the input orbserver if there is a 
read error, an end of file, or if there has been no activity
on the read socket for some specified time (see -rcnt_time).
When orbcp decides to reconnect to the input orbserver it
first closes the exisiting socket, reopens a read connection
to the orbserver, selects using the -src selection string (if
specified), and attempts to position the read pointer to the
next pktid that should be read. If the input reconnect flag
is not specified, then any read errors will cause the program
to terminate.
.IP "-orcnt"
Output reconnect flag. If this is specified, then orbcp will
attempt to reconnect to the output orbserver if there is a 
write error.
When orbcp decides to reconnect to the output orbserver it
suspends all reads until a new output connection is established.
If the output reconnect flag
is not specified, then any write errors will cause the program
to terminate.
.IP "-pktstart pktid"
A packet id for initially positioning the read pointer. If this
is not specified, then the read pointer will be initially
positioned to the newest packet.
.IP "-rcnt_time minutes"
The maximum number of minutes for determining inactivity on the
read socket. The default value is 10 minutes.
.IP "-npackets npackets"
A total packet count for copying. orbcp will exit when this
count is reached. If not specified, then orbcp will execute
indefinitely.
