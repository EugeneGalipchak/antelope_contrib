.TH GURALP2ORB 1
.SH NAME
guralp2orb \- Import Guralp data over UDP port into Antelope ORB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
guralp2orb \[-v\] \[-pf parameter_file\] orbname port
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
guralp2orb receives seismic data from Guralp digitizers in GCF format
and puts these data, unpacked, onto an Antelope ORB. The data are put on
the ORB in Iceworm format, meaning there is an optional pin number in the
data packet. 

A parameter file specifies the network, station, and channel names to which
each guralp system ID and stream ID should be translated. Unwanted streams
may be ignored by setting the "chan" field in the parameter file (see below)
to "Ignore".  guralp2orb rereads its parameter file once every 10 packets,
allowing dynamic reconfiguration of the running program. 

guralp2orb ignores status packets (state-of-health packets) from the digitizer.
.SH OPTIONS
-v verbose. List system ID and stream ID of each incoming packet, along with
the ORB source identifier to which it is converted.

-pf parameter_file. Allows optional specification of the parameter file. 
.SH FILES
The parameter file is guralp2orb.pf, unless otherwise specified with the 
-pf option.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Packets containing non-integral numbers of seconds worth of data are
not technically valid GCF packets, but are sometimes sent anyway
by older digitizers (firmware versions circa V.031). Guralp2orb
trims these packets to the nearest even number of seconds, on the 
advice of Guralp Systems Ltd. 

The Posix time_t standard (IEEE 1003.1) does not include leap seconds. 
The Antelope/Datascope epoch-time implementation agrees with POSIX. 
Scream's interpretation of the digitizer timestamps agree with the
Datascope interpretation. Therefore guralp2orb ignores leap seconds.
