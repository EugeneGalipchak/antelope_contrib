dbms \- compute ms magnitudes 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

dbms [-a auth_match] 
    [-f filter]
    [-n net] 
    [-o orid_match] 
    [-t twin] 
    [-v] 
    dbin

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdbms\fP computes surface-wave magnitude \fIms\fR\fR based on the 
following equation:
.nf

        ms = log(Amp) + 1.66*log(delta) + 2.0

        where:

        Amp   -  amplitude of the Rayleigh wave on the vertical 
                 component in micrometers;
        delta -  distance between source and receiver in degrees; 
.fi

.LP
The calculated magnitude is stored in \fInetmag\fR, \fIorigin\fR and  
\fIstamag\fR tables.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-a auth_match"
Only origin records which \fIauth\fR matches the regular expression \fIauth_match\fR
will be selected for magnitude computation. By default all records are selected.
.IP "-f filter"
Specifies filter which will be used to filter data before magnitude computation.
Filter should be specified in a form "FL FLO FH FHO", where:
.nf
          FL  -  The lower cutoff frequency in hz.
          FLO -  The order of the lower cutoff sideband.
          FH  -  The upper cutoff frequency in hz.
          FHO -  The order of the upper cutoff sideband.
.fi
By default,  "0.025 7 0.1 7" filter is used. 

.IP "-o orid_math"
Only origin records which \fIorid\fR matches the regular expression \fIorid_match\fR
will be selected for magnitude computation. By deafult \fIms\fR will be computed for
every \fIorid\fR. 
.IP "-n net"
Specifies network code. This network code will be used to fill a \fInetmag\fR table. 
.IP "-t twin"
Set a time window for a maximum \fIamplitude\fR search. By default, time window is
20 minutes from a predicted first surface wave arrival.
.IP "-v"
Be more verbose.
.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
Compute ms for 'india' databse for all origin records with 'auth'== "UCSD.*"; 
network is "knet"; filter data with "0.1 5 1.0 5" filter before computation.

.nf

dbms -a "UCSD.*" -f "0.1 5 1.0 5" -n "knet" india

.fi
.LP
Compute ms for knet database for 'orid' = 12* origins ; use default filter.
.nf

dbms -o "12.*" knet
