rrp2orb:

An NEIC RRP client that will collect Mini-SEED records from an RRP
ring file and send them to an Antelope ORB.

The client will search recieved records for a 1000 blockette.
The packet will be dropped if no 1000 blockette is found.

The network code in the Mini-SEED records can be changed using the
'-n' command line option.  The change is done after matching (if the
'-m' option is used).

For testing it is recommended that you use the verbose flag twice "-vv",
then the client will report on each packet that is received from the
ring.
