.SH NAME
rrp2orb \- RRP Mini-SEED to Antelope ORB module
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
rrp2orb [options] -ring ringfile ORB

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrrp2orb\fP reads Mini-SEED records from an RRP (Ring Replication
Protocol) ring file and sends them to an ORB as packet type 'SEED'.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP "-V"
Print the program version and exit.

.IP "-h"
Print the program help/usage and exit.

.IP "-v"
Be more verbose.  This flag can be used multiple times ("-v -v" or 
"-vv") for more verbosity.

.IP "-m \fImatch\fP"
Specify a regular expression to limit which records are sent to the
ORB to only those which match.  The \fImatch\fP pattern is compared to
the SEED record source parameters in the following
form: 'NET_STA_LOC_CHAN'.

.IP "-n \fIcode\fP"
Change the network code of the data records (after matching) before
sending them to the ORB.

.IP "-ring \fIringfile\fP (required)"
Specify the ring file from which to read Mini-SEED records.  This is a
required parameter.

.IP "-mod \fIinterval\fP"
Save the ring reader status file (reader position) every
\fIinterval\fP packets.  By default the status file will be saved
every 100 packets.

.IP "-ext \fIreaderid\fP"
Use the \fIreaderid\fP as an extension on the reader's status file.
This reader ID must be unique for each reader of the ring file.  If
not specified it will default to ".ringstat".  If two ring readers are
running concurrently and using the default (or same) status file
extension (\fIreaderid\fP) mayhem will ensue, or at least the readers
might be confused about their actual read position on restart.

.IP "-MD \fImappingdb\fR"
Use the specified database for mapping SEED names to CSS database
names.  If the channel names do not exist in the specified database
they will be inserted.  The database should be specified using an
absolute path.

.IP "-CD \fIcalibdb\fR"
Copy calib, calper and segtype from the calibration table in the
specified database.  Recommended if the data will be processed
directly from the ORB since this information is not available
in the data stream.  A mapping database must also be specified
using the -MD option.  The database should be specified using an
absolute path.

.IP "-r"
Use the database specified with the -MD option to remap input net,
sta, chan, and loc codes to local sta and chan codes.  This can be
helpful when processing this data with programs that do not
recognize the loc code in the source name.

.IP "\fIORB\fR"
A required argument.  Specifies the location of the ORB server in
[host]:[port] format.  If 'host' is omitted 'localhost' is assumed.
If 'port' is omitted the default ORB port is assumed.

.SH "RRP"
The RRP system was designed by and being used to deliver data from the
NEIC.

A ring reader's status file is always written to the same directory as
the ring file itself and is named "<ringfile><readerid>".  As an
example, the default reader id is ".ringstat", for a reader using the
default ID reading a ring file at:

.nf
/data/import/ringfile
.fi

the reader's status file will be written to:

.nf
/data/import/ringfile.ringstat
.fi
