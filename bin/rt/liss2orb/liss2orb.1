.SH NAME
liss2orb \- read data in LISS format 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

liss2orb [-d database] [-m match] [-s pktsize] [-t timeout] [-v] liss-server orb

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBliss2orb\fP reads seismic data in LISS format from a \fIliss-server\fR 
and sends it to an \fBorb\fP ring buffer.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-d database"
Copy calib, calper and segtype from the calibration table in the
specified database.  (Since this information is not available from the
datafeed, it has to be obtained from a static database; this database
can be generated using psd2db and the corresponding dataless seed
volume from the IRIS DMC).

.IP "-m match"
Only packets with srcname containing the regular expression \fImatch\fR
are forwarded to the orbserver.

.IP "-s pktsize"
liss2orb attempts to derive the individual packet size by inspecting
the name of the liss server.  Currently, at least, all packets are
512 bytes, except for packets from the GT network, where packets
are all 256 bytes.  Consequently, liss2orb inspects the liss server name;
if it contains the (case insensitive) string ".gt.", liss2orb expects
256 byte packets, and otherwise 512 byte packets.

.IP "-t timeout"
Specify a timeout on the read.  This should not be necessary.

.IP "-v"
Be more verbose, mentioning each packet copied.

.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
Read data from an kono.iu.liss.org remote site.  Select data only for
BHZ, BHN, BHE channels and store them in a bbarray:9999 ORB.  Fill in
calib, calper and segtype from the calibration table of the database
asl.

.nf

liss2orb -d asl -m "BH[ZNE]" kono.iu.liss.org bbarray:9999

.fi
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The individual packets are SEED data blocks containing 
blockette 1000's.  The blockette 1000 should specify the 
data block size, but currently ( 9/15/1999 ) some 1000
blockettes contain the wrong size.  Hence the size is
derived from either explicit command line argument or
by inspecting the liss server name.
