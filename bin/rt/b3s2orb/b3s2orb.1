.SH DESCRIPTION
An \fBb3s2orb\fP is a tool to communicate with \fIB3S2\fR - read data,
send commands to a DAS.  At a start \fBb3s2orb\fP opens a \fIUser Interface
Menu - UIM\fR through which user can turn-on/turn-off seismometer, set a
calibration type and mode, start/stop a data capture. During a data capture
\fIUIM\fR is used to view diagnostic parameters such as \fIDAS reset, upper/lower
temperature, time errors\fR , etc. A \fBb3s2orb\fP opens two ports to \fIB3S2\fR -
command port and data port. A command port is used to send commands to a DAS. 
A data port is used to read data from DAS. A \fBb3s2orb\fP parses those packets,  
pre-appends a specific header to each \fIB3S2\fR packet 
and sends them to an orb. 

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-c cmdport"
Specifies a name of a command port. A port /dev/ttya is used by default.
.IP "-i dataport"
Specifies a name of a data port. A port /dev/ttyb is used by default.
.IP "-o orbname"
Specifies an orb name. A \fIlocalhost\fR is used by default.
.IP "-p parameter-file"
A parameter file \fIparameter-file\fR will be used to get parameters of a raw 
data packet, it's type, header type; to get station and channel names code
for each component of a raw data packet. A \fBpkt.pf\fP parameter file is used by default.
.IP "-s"
Tells \fBb3s2orb\fP do not open an \fIUIM\fR and start data capture in a 
silent mode. By default, \fIUIM\fR is opened and data capture should be start
by pressing \fI"CAPTURE DATA"\fR button. 
.IP "-v"
If this option specified \fBb3s2orb\fP will print to 
stdout a \fIsrcname\fR and a time of each packets before sending them
to an orb.

.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
Start reading data from port /dev/ttyb ( default data port) in a 
silent mode - do not open \fIUIM\fR ; print srcname and time of each packet;
send packets to an orb on bbarray:
.nf

b3s2orb -s -o bbarray -v
