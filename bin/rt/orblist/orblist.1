.SH NAME
orblist \- list an orb contents

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

\fBorblist \fP[-d]     [-h]     [-m \fIsrcmatch\fP]     [-n
                \fItime_diff\fP]     [-s]     \fIorb\fP [\fIstart\fP
                [\fItwindow\fP]]

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
An \fBorblist\fP reads packets from an \fIorb\fP ring buffer and
print to stdout information about those packets. An \fBorblist\fP  prints
srcname and time of a packet. It also checks packets time with
"expected" packet time - time which is calculated based on size of a packet
and a sample rate.  If packet time is not equal to "expected" time
an \fBorblist\fP print a mesage about this. This program is very
usefull if user wants quickly to check data on a time gaps or to get
a hexdump of a orb packets.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP "-d"
Tells \fBorblist\fP to print a hexdump of orb packets.

.IP "-h"
Tells \fBorblist\fP to print a hexdump of a raw packets. A raw packet is an
orb packet without orb header.

.IP "-m srcmatch"
Only  packets   which a srcname matches the regular expression \fIsrcmatch\fP
will be read from an orb.

.IP "-n time_diff "
Specify in seconds an expected time difference between packets.

.IP "-s"
Usually an \fBorblist\fP reads packets from an orb and puts them in a pipe
sorted by time.  This options tells \fBorblist\fP do not sort packets.

.IP "start [twindow]"
Specify a time range of packets which will be read from an orb.

.SH EXAMPLE

.LP
Read packets with a srcname matching ".*1S" regular expression from bbarray orb;
time difference between packets expected to be 60 seconds.
