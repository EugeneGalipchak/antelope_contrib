.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

orblist [-d] 
    [-h]
    [-m srcmatch]
    [-n time_diff]
    [-s] 
    orb [start [twindow]]

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
An \fBorblist\fP reads packets from an \fIorb\fR ring buffer and
print to stdout information about those packets. An \fBorblist\fP  prints
srcname and time of a packet. It also checks packets time with 
"expected" packet time - time which is calculated based on size of a packet
and a sample rate.  If packet time is not equal to "expected" time
an \fBorblist\fP print a mesage about this. This program is very
usefull if user wants quickly to check data on a time gaps or to get 
a hexdump of an orb packets . 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-d"
Tells \fBorblist\fP to print a hexdump of an orb packets.
.IP "-h"
Tells \fBorblist\fP to print a hexdump of a raw packets. A raw packet is an 
orb packet without orb header.
.IP "-m srcmatch"
Only  packets   which a srcname matches the regular expression \fI srcmatch\fR
will be read from an orb.
.IP "-n time_diff "
Specify in seconds an expected time difference between packets.
.IP "-s"
Usually an \fBorblist\fP reads packets from an orb and puts them in a pipe 
sorted by time.  This options tells \fBorblist\fP do not sort packets.
.IP "start [twindow]"
Specify a time range of packets which will be read from an orb.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
Read packets with a srcname matching ".*1S" regular expression from bbarray orb;
time difference between packets expected to be 60 seconds.

.nf

orblist -m ".*1S" -n 60 bbarray
