.TH ORBLIST 1 "$Date$"

.SH NAME
orblist \- list an orb contents

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

\fBorblist \fP[-d] [-h] [-m \fIsrcmatch\fP] [-n \fItime_diff\fP] [-s] \fIorb\fP [\fIstart\fP [\fItwindow\fP]]

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBorblist\fP reads packets from an \fIorb\fP ring buffer and
prints to stdout information about those packets. \fBorblist\fP prints
the srcname and time of each packet. It also checks packet time against
"expected" packet time - a time which is calculated based on the size of the packet
and a sample rate.  If the packet time is not equal to the "expected" time
an \fBorblist\fP print a mesage about this. This program is very
useful if the user wants quickly to check data on time gaps or to get
a hexdump of orb packets.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP "-d"
Tells \fBorblist\fP to print a hexdump of orb packets.

.IP "-h"
Tells \fBorblist\fP to print a hexdump of raw packets. A raw packet is an
orb packet without the orb header.

.IP "-m srcmatch"
Only  packets with a srcname matching the regular expression \fIsrcmatch\fP
will be read from an orb.

.IP "-n time_diff "
Specify in seconds an expected time difference between packets.

.IP "-s"
Usually \fBorblist\fP reads packets from an orb and puts them in a pipe
sorted by time.  This option tells \fBorblist\fP not to sort packets.

.IP "start [twindow]"
Specify a time range of packets which will be read from an orb.

.SH EXAMPLE

.LP
Read packets with a srcname matching ".*1S" regular expression from bbarray orb;
time difference between packets expected to be 60 seconds.
