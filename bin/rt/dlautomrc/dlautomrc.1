.SH DESCRIPTION
dlautomrc issues mass recenter commands to remote dataloggers and can be controlled
by the following options.


.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-d dltype"
Default datalogger type.  Override value in pf file which currently defaults to "q330".  
Mixed datalogger networks are not currently supported.  Separate instances of the script
will have to be run.
.IP -f
Force a mass recenter despite mass positions not being out of range.  Will
only work with the \fI-s\fP option, not with \fI-a\fP.
.IP -n
Test mode. Only report what would be done.  Do not issue any mass recentering commands.
This is highly recommended for testing prior to implementing daily runs of this
script.
.IP "-p pfname"
Use the specified pfname instead of the default dlautomrc.pf
.IP -v
Be verbose and report some extra information.
.IP -V
Be very verbose and report some extra information.
.IP "-x dl_sta1,dl_sta2,..."
Comma separated list of stations to ignore when checking all stations for mass recenters.   
.IP "-a voltage_trigger"
Value beyond which the mass position readings are considered "out of range".  Check 
mass positions of all stations to see if they are beyond this value.  This is
not the actual voltage value, but rather the value that is reported by the datalogger.  For
instance, \fIq3302orb\fP reports values that are 10 * voltage.  So a possible value to 
use would be "50" rather than "5" - any sensor that is beyond +/- 5V would get a mass
recenter.  Note that the value should be the positive out of range value.  
.IP "-s dl_sta1,dl_sta2,..."
Comma separated list of stations to check for needed mass recenters.  With \fI-f\fP, will 
force a mass recenter regardless of the actual mass position reading.  
.IP "-m mail1,mail2,mail3,..."
List of email addresses to receive success or failure status emails.  The 
email message reports the mass positions of the sensors both before and
after the mass recenters. 
.IP cmd_orb
Orb where command orb packets (<targetname>/pf/dlcm) are collected.  You must have 
write permission for this orb.  This is a mandatory argument.
.IP status_orb
Orb where status orb packets (<targetname>/pf/st) are collected.  You must have read
permission for this orb.  This is a mandatory argument.
.IP target
A targetname that identifies particular instances of \fBq3302orb\fR or \fBrt2orb\fR.  This can be
wildcarded so that multiple targets can be reviewed for out of range mass positions.  This is an 
optional argument.  The default targetname is all targetnames aka ".*".

.SH PARAMETER FILE
The following is an example parameter file.

# pf file for dlautomrc

dltype          q330            # default datalogger type
                                # for a mixed system run with either -s option, or -x exclude

out_of_range    50              # absolute value of out of range mass position voltage
                                #   mass positions >= out_of_range will trigger a mass recenter

mrc_delay       30              # interval in seconds to wait between mass recenters if -a is used
                                # Setting this to "0" or a small value will speed up execution of
                                # mass recenters but may introduce a false event

delay_interval  300             # interval to wait after mass recenter before checking mass positions

.IP dltype
Default datalogger type.  Currently, for mixed datalogger systems, multiple runs of the
program are needed.  Can be overriden with the \fI-d\fP option.  Default value: q330.
.IP out_of_range
Absolute value of out of range mass position value. Can be overriden with the \fI-a\fP option.
Default value: 50.
.IP mrc_delay
Interval in seconds to wait between issuing mass recenter commands.  Issuing mass recenters
within a short time window can introduce false triggers.
Default value: 30.
.IP delay_interval
Interval in seconds to wait after mass recenter before rechecking mass positions.
Default value: 300.

.SH EXAMPLE
.IP \(bu
Check all stations in each instance of data acquisition for tadata.* and
only show me what ones would require mass recenter commands, but do not 
actually execute those commands. Ignore station TA_G03A.

.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf
.ne 4
%\fB dlautomrc -m "jeakins@ucsd.edu" -n -a 50 -x "TA_G03A" :qcmd :usarray \fP

.fi
.in
.ft R

.IP \(bu
Force a mass recenter command for TA_A04A, TA_G03A, TA_M01C, and TA_U04C. 

.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf
.ne 4
%\fB dlautomrc -m "jeakins@ucsd.edu" -s "TA_A04A,TA_G03A,TA_M01C,TA_U04C" :qcmd :usarray\fP

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
In single station mode, if the masses are not out of range, no mass recenter
will be executed.  Override this with the \fI-f\fP flag if you want to recenter anyway.  
You cannot force all stations to mass recenter (i.e. you must combine  -fI-f\fP and \fI-s\fP flags).

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.nf
q3302orb(1), rt2orb(1), dlcmd(1)
.fi
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
You could be sending more mass recenters than your system needs.  Make sure
you use the test mode with the \fI-n\fP option until you are sure of what you are
doing.

This should work with both rt130 and q330 dataloggers.  It has not been tested on rt130s.
