dbnew2orb \- transfer modified database rows to an orbserver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdbnew2orb \fP[-sleep \fIseconds\fP] [-pf \fIpfname\fP] [-state \fIstatefile\fP]
                [-prefix \fIprefix\fP] [-modified_after \fItime\fP] [-v] \fIdb\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdbnew2orb\fP watches a database for modifications and sends modified rows to an orbserver. It allows to transfer a database so that it can be used on the receiving side with programs that keep the database open like e.g. dbevents.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-sleep seconds"
\fIseconds\fP specifies the number of \fIseconds\fP to wait between iterations over all database tables. Defaults to 60 \fIseconds\fP.
.IP "pf pfname"
Specify a \fIpfname\fP as the parameter file name for \fBdbnew2orb\fP. Defaults to \fBdbnew2orb\fP.
.IP "state statefile"
Specify a \fIstatefile\fP used for saving and restoring the modification times (lddate) of the database rows. Note that due to rounding errors some rows could be retransmitted after a restart.
.IP "-prefix prefix"
This can be used to distinguish between different databases on the orbserver. Defaults to dbn2orb.
.IP "-modified_after time"
Transfer only rows that have been modified after \fItime\fP.
.IP "-v"
verbose flag
.IP "db"
Input database.
.IP "orb"
Name of the target \fIorb\fP.
.SH "PARAMETER FILE"
The \fBdbnew2orb\fP parameter file contains parameter that control how and when modified rows are sent to the destination orbserver. Following is the default parameter file:

.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf

.ne 10

sleep   60                                      #naptime between checks
check_lddate_interval   5       #check lddate every nth iteration
\fIprefix\fP  dbn2orb                         #sourcenames <\fIprefix\fP>/\fIdb\fP/<tablename>
ignore_tables   &Tbl{
}
check_tables    &Tbl{
        affiliation
}

.fi
.ft R
.in
.LP
Parameter definitions are as follows:
.IP sleep
This is the \fItime\fP in \fIseconds\fP to wait between iterations over all tables.
.IP check_lddate_interval
Since a check of lddate is \fItime\fP consuming, the program checks most of the times only the modification times of the database tables. But to see also modifications of existing rows, a check of the lddates is performed only every check_lddate_interval.
.IP prefix
This \fIprefix\fP can be used to distinguish between several datanase on the destination orbserver.
.IP "ignore_tables, check_tables"
List of tablenames that wil (or will not) be transferred to the orbserver.

Export one of the example databases:

dbnew2orb:  2/21/2005  20:30:30.814: 4 patcket(s) sent with sourcename: db2orb/db/stamag

save the demo database on the other side:
> orb2dbt -select "db2orb.*" -overwrite : copy-of-demo

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The program cannot transfer tables that point to external files, i.e. those with the field dfile. Furthermore it ignores the lastid and remark tables. The latter is a pity...
