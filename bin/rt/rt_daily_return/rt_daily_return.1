.SH NAME
rt_daily_return \- write data gaps for a database over a time period into db
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBrt_daily_return \fP[-vz]
        [-n \fInetcode\fP]
        [-s \fIsubset\fP]
        [-t \fIstart_time\fP]
        [-e \fIend_time\fP]
            \fIdbin\fP \fIdbout\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrt_daily_return\fP writes a summary of data gaps for a database \fIdb\fP by channel.
The output database contains a list of all gaps by station, channel, and
time, along with network summaries.  
Program execs rtoutage(1) for each day of data processed.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-n netcode"
Restrict report to stations where the net code matches
the regular expression netcode.  Network membership is
determined through the snetsta table, not affiliation.
.IP "-s subset"
Perform the specified \fIsubset\fP on the input table (or sensor) to select
the desired stations and channels.
.IP "-t start_time"
When to start processing.
.IP "-e end_time"
When to stop processing.
.IP "-v"
Verbose.
.IP "-z"
Select only channels ending in 'z' or 'Z', or where the
third  character  is  'z'  or  'Z'.  This is useful for
reducing the output in networks where  the  outages  on
any 3 channels for the same station and sample rate are
the same.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP "No records in sensor table for '\fItable\fP'"
.IP "No records in deployment table '\fItable\fP'"
