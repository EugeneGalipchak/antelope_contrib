.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrt_daily_return\fP writes a summary of data gaps for a database \fIdb\fP by channel.
The output database contains a list of all gaps by station, channel, and
time, along with network summaries.  Program starts with the oldest data which is
not already in the gap table, and steps forward in day increments to the last assumed 
complete day of data.

This is set up for realtime systems 
with reasonable size field buffers and we are attempting to measure the data return through the 
realtime system.  For example the 32 Mbyte Q330s stores more than 24 hours of data for a 40 sps 
acquistion rate, a CD1.0 system might have up to 14 days.

Program execs rtoutage(1) for each day of data processed.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-n netcode"
Restrict report to stations where the net code matches
the regular expression netcode.  Network membership is
determined through the snetsta table, not affiliation.
.IP "-s subset"
Perform the specified \fIsubset\fP on the input table (or sensor) to select
the desired stations and channels.
.IP "-d delay_days"
Number of complete days to delay processing. The default value is 1 day delay.
.IP "-t start_time"
When to start processing.
.IP "-e end_time"
When to stop processing.
.IP "-v"
Verbose.
.IP "-z"
Select only channels ending in 'z' or 'Z', or where the
third  character  is  'z'  or  'Z'.  This is useful for
reducing the output in networks where  the  outages  on
any 3 channels for the same station and sample rate are
the same.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP "No records in sensor table for '\fItable\fP'"
.IP "No records in deployment table '\fItable\fP'"

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This program is designed to work on day long intervals.  All times are rounded off to the day
boundaries.
