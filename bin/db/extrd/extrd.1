.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Program reads seismic data in CSS 3.0 format, the wfdisc files of which are specified by one of the arguments (dbname |  wfd_dir | wfd_fnames).
and extracts the specified subset of data. 
Program will create a data file and a wfdisc file with name of the form YYDDDHHMM.w and YYDDDHHMM.wfdisc respectively,
which give the year, day, hour, and minute of the begining of the event.
The output names are based on the 'real' start time of data subset. 
If there are data which start on the start time specified on the command line  in the \fIwfd_dir\fR then that time will be used for output names.
If data starts later then the time specified on the command line, the data start time will be used for output names.
If \fIout_dir\fR is specified in the command line then the program will create such 
directory and all output data will be placed there otherwise the output data will be placed in a current directory.
