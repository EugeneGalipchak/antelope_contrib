.SH NAME
assoc_rayleigh \- associates rayleigh wave picks to origins
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
assoc_rayleigh [-v] db origin_db 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
assoc_rayleigh associates rows in the arrival table in db with "iphase=='R'"
with the origin table in origin_db.  The condition for association is
that an R arrival must occur with a velocity between 3.4 and 4.2 km/sec
based on the origin_db origin.time, db arrival.time and the 
distance between the site and the origin.  For each origin-arrival subset 
which satisfies these conditions, a check is made to see if the origin 
already exists in the db origin table by matching the lat, lon, depth, time,
auth fields. If so, then the value of nass is updated and the rows are added to the assoc table.  If the origin does not match, but is within 1 degree in
distance and 60 seconds in origin time, then a new origin is added to 
the db origin table using the same evid as the existing origin in 
db origin.  Otherwise a new origin and event are added to db.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
very verbose
.SH FILES
needs a minimum of arrival table and site table in db.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
needs to be run in ANTELOPE environment
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
assoc_rayleigh will associate any origins in origin_db with the "R"
arrivals in db.  It does not look at magnitudes or any other criteria,
so it is possible to get mis-associations.  The best way to deal with this
is to run dbverify to identify which arrivals are associated with multiple
events, followed by dbloc2 to remove the offending events.
