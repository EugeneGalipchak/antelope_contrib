.SH NAME
mwapbavg - combutes averages mwap results over multiple frequency bands
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
mwapbavg db [-pf pffile -phase phase]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program is intended to be run after the multiwavelet array processing
program (mwap) to produce an combined, broadband estimate of the timing parameters
that mwap estimates.  That is, mwap uses multiwavelets to produce narrow
band estimates of the slowness vector, time residuals relative to the
best fit plane wave, polarization measurements, and relative amplitudes. 
The parameters most related to time (slowness vector and residuals) 
are the ones handled by mwapbavg.  The reason a special program is required
is that the slowness vector and residuals are inseparably linked.  
Any slowness vector deviation from one band estimate to another produces
a planar structure to the residual surface that has to be taken into
account to produce an unbiased, broadband estimate.
.LP
The mwapbavg program uses the following algorithm to produce a band average:
.IP (1)
A weighted slowness vector average is computed by using an inverse 
covariance weighting for each band.  That is, we compute 
.EQ
bold u sub avg = left [ sum from {i=1} to {N sub bands} 
bold C sub i sup {-2} right ] sup {-1}
sum from {i=1} to {N sub bands} bold C sub i sup {-1} bold u sub i 
.EN
.IP (2)
All time residuals in each band are corrected for the difference in the 
plane wave correction for the band estimate relative to the average 
computed in step (1).
.IP (3)
The global average is computed as a weighted sum of residuals using
weighting by the reciprocal of the estimated time errors in each band.  
(i.e. the errstatic field in the mwtstatic extension table created
by mwap.)
.IP (4)
The arrival table is updated using the the band average residuals and
the related slowness vector and plane-wave correction statics.
.LP
One should be aware that the arrivals computed by this method are
likely to differ from those an analyst would produce.  They are more
like what one would produce by cross correlation, but it is more
complicated because the window used is frequency dependent.  
.LP
Note this algorith adds new entries for the band averages to the
extension tables mwslow and mwtstatic.  It also updates arriva
as noted above.  
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
\fB-pf\fR allows use of an alternative parameter file to mwapbavg.pf.
.LP
\fB-phase\fR allows specification of a phase name other than the default
of P.
.SH FILES
.LP
Accesses the following database tables:  arrival, assoc, event, origin, mwslow, mwtstatic.
The arrival, mwslow, and mwtstatic tables are updated.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.LP
The parameter file used by mwapbavg should, in general, be a copy of the
parameter file used by mwap.  This is the simplest way to guarantee 
consistency in parameters required by mwapbavg with those used by 
mwap.  Obviously, many of the parameters used by mwap are not used
by mwapbavg, but this is the practical way to run this.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
The averaging algorithm used for the slowness vectors is exact provided
the covariance is properly estimated by mwap.  In contrast the 
averaging for residuals is an approximation that may tend to underestimate
uncertainties.  It neglects covariance between the slowness estimates 
and residuals.  Since we equalize all data to a common slowness vector
before averaging this seems correct, but doesn't really correctly 
account for the true error model which involves coupling between
slowness vector errors and residuals.  I judged it preferable to give
a simple numerical estimate than try to characterize the massive 
covariance mess of the simultaneous problem.  
.LP
Note that this program does not use any robust methods under and
assumption these were taken care of in mwap.  The results may 
be highly suspect if features like signal-to-noise cutoffs were
disabled in mwap.
