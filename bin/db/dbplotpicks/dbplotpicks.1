.SH NAME
dbplotpicks \- Make waveform plots with arrivals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dbplotpicks
.I dbname
.I sta_expr
.I chan_expr
.I tstart
.I twinline
.I scale
.I [-f filter]
.I [-ps psfile]
.I [-display]
.I [-polygons polygondb]
.I [-places placesdb]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dbplotpicks
will make a PostScript output file that contains a helicorder
style display of one or more station(s)-channel(s) including arrivals. The output file
name begins with \fIdbplotpicks.\fP and ends with \fI.ps\fP and
is unique to avoid collisions with previously created PostScript
files.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fIdbname\fP
The name of the input database.
This argument is required.
.IP \fIsta_expr\fP
A regular expression determining the station(s).
This argument is required.
.IP \fIchan_expr\fP
A regular expression determining the channels(s).
This argument is required.
.IP \fItstart\fP
The start time for the display.
This argument is required.
.IP \fItwinline\fP
The time window for each sta-chan line in the display in seconds.
This argument is required.
.IP \fIscale\fP
The amplitude scale factor in data units per inch or \fI-1\fP, which indicates autoscaling.
This argument is required.
.IP "\fI-f filter\fP"
A filter specification. This filter is applied to
the waveform before it is plotted.
The \fIfilter\fP specification is a character string like
"BW 0.1 5 1.0 5" which would be a 5 order Butterworth filter
with a low corner frequency of 0.1 Hz and a high corner
frequency of 1.0 Hz. See trfilter(3). Note that specifications such as
this with embedded blanks must be quoted in the command line.
This argument is optional and if not specified, then
no filtering is done.
.IP "\fI-ps psfile\fP"
The output PostScript file name.
This argument is optional and if not specified, then
a unique PostScript file name is created by the program.
.IP "\fI-display \fP"
If this flag is given, the PostScript file will be displayed immediately.
This argument is optional.
.IP "\fI-places dbplaces\fP"
Name of databases with places (in places1.2 schema). If this argument is specified and origin information associated to arrivals in the specified time-window is found in the database, then the place closest to the origin is displayed.
This argument is optional.
.IP "\fI-polygons dbpolygons\fP"
Name of databases with polygons (in polygon1.2 schema). If this argument is specified and origin information associated to arrivals in the specified time-window is found in the database, then the name of the polygon surrounding the origin is displayed.
This argument is optional.
.SH EXAMPLE
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf

.ne 7

  dbplotpicks db "ARSA|DAVA" "HHZ" "7/19/1999" 30 -1 -display

  will display 30 seconds from all Z-channels for stations
  ARSA and DAVA, starting from July 19th 1999 Midnight,
  using autoscaling

.ne 7
  dbplotpicks db "ARSA|DAVA" "HHZ" "7/19/1999" 30 500 -display \\
     -places /databases/places -polygons /databases/polygons \\
         -ps /tmp/testrun.ps

  same as above, but with a fixed scale of 500nm/s/inch. The
  place next to the preferred origin and the countryname are
  also given. The filename is known.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Certainly  a lot. This was the first program I wrote at ZAMG after we decided to use the Antelope Software. The calling could need some fixes.
