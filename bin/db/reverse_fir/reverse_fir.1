.TH REVERSE_FIR 1 2003/06/18 "Antelope Contrib SW" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
reverse_fir \- reverse the Quanterra minimum phase filters from the
original inverse time domain as found on Quanterra digitizers to the
time domain as should be found in the stage directory of the Antelope dbmaster.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
reverse_fir [-v] [-n] [-p pffile] stage_dir
.fi


.SH DESCRIPTION
As pointed out by Reinoud Sleeman from KNMI and confirmed by Quanterra
(see below) on Quanterra digitizers the FIR filters are in inverse
time domain, for efficiency reasons. To generate full SEED or autodrm
replies the order of the stage filter coefficients in the Antelope
dbmaster/response/stage/F*M files has to be reversed. This can be done
with reverse_fir.

Hi Grisa,

Sorry for the delay in my reply.

The filternames ending with 'M' are minimum phase, that is
filters FS2D5M and F96CM. However, on the Quanterra the
coefficients are stored in reverse order (confirmed by
Quanterra), so the largest coefficients are at the end.
In the SEED file these filters should appear as minimum-phase,
as this is how they are used in the convolution and downsampling 
process. So the coefficients can not be taken directly from the 
Quanterra but should be reversed (largest coefficients in the
beginning).

The responses of CEY, CRES and LJU all have asymmetrical filters,
as for example the FIR filter at stage 4 for CEY-BHZ. As you can see
the energy of the filter is concentrated at the end. This filter
(F96CM) seems to be copied directly from the Quanterra (see the
/r0/FIRFilters file). So, in my opinion the order of the coeff's
for the asymmetrical filters needs to be reversed in your database.

What do you think ?

Cheers, Reinoud

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-v" 
verbose flag
.IP "-n"
simulates execution, but does not create the inverted filter file
.IP "-p pffile" 
parameter file. The list of filters to be inverted.
.IP "stage_dir"
Stage directory of the dbmaster. This argument is required.

.SH PARAMETER FILE

The following is a sample parameter file. It consists of one
table \fBfilters\fP. Only filter F96CM will be reversed.
.nf
filters &Tbl{
#F400M
F96CM
#FS2D5M
}
.fi
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The filters have to be specified in a parameter file. Use reverse_fir
on a COPY of the filters and check before copying the reversed filters
to the proper place!

Works only with filters with no denominator coefficients.
