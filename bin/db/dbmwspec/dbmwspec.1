.TH DBMWSPEC 1 # "$Date$"
.SH NAME
dbmwspec \- computes multitaper spectral estimates for selected phases
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
dbmwspec dbin [-V -pf pffile -s spec_dir -jack -correct]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program computes multitaper spectral estimates from seismic data 
in windows around selected times taken from the arrival table.  It
is intimately linked to the css3.0 schema and is designed as a
batch program to process a large collection of seismograms in 
a single run.  dbin is the input css3.0 database.  Output is saved
in this same database using the specdisc table.
.LP
The program keys on times associated with rows in an arrival table.
It can process multiple phases in a single pass with multiple
window definitions and/or resolution specifications to the multitaper
routine.  The basic algorithm works from a list of window definitions
defined in the input parameter file (see below).  Each window definition
is defined relative to a named seismic phase (e.g. P, S, PcP, etc.).
.LP
This program blindly processes all channels of data and tags the output
spectral estimates by the channel code with which they were originally
associated.  If data gaps occur within a requested window the program
will use the largest data segment within that window to compute the
spectral estimate.  
.LP
The primary output of this program is a set of files indexed by 
the specdisc table.  The specdisc is similar to wfdisc and 
defines a method for indexing spectral files.  
The output file
names for spectra are derived from the parent waveform file name by adding
an appendage of "_mwspec" to the name.  For example,
if the parent waveform dfile name was evid_20001.w the spectra 
for all data derived from this file would be contained in a file
called evid_20001.w_mwspec.  Multiple spectral estimates may be
contained in one of these files with appropriate values of foff 
defined in the specdisc table just as multiple waveforms can be
present in one file for a wfdisc table.  
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -V
Prints the contrib banner at the top of the output log.  
Program will go ahead an run even if
if this flag is set.  Some Antelope programs treat this like
the --help in gnu.  It is not a verbose flag as might be
implied.  
.IP -pf
Default reads a parameter file called dbmwspec.pf.  Use this 
optional parameter to change this.  
.IP -s
Use this parameter to write output files in a directory other
than the default of "./spectra".
.IP -jack
Compute and save 95% confidence limits computed by jackknife
error estimates.  
.IP -correct
Use response information to correct spectral estimates.
This only works if a valid join of wfdisc->sensor->instrument 
is possible.  That is, although this should be obvious you
should not use this option unless you have
complete response information for your data for all time
periods you wish to process.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.LP
\fIspectra_windows\fR.  This is an &Tbl parameter that defines
the time window and smoothing properties to be used to compute
the multitaper spectral estimates.  The &Tbl{ and } should
enclose a series of lines of the form:
.nf
phase	start	end tbw
.fi
where \fIphase\fR is the name of the seismic phase to use to 
define the time window for each pick (e.g. P, S, etc.).  
\fIstart\fR and 
\fIend\fR define the times relative to the pick time for 
this phase for the start and end time of the window respectively.
\fItbw\fR is the time-bandwidth product for the multitaper
spectral estimate.  Larger tbw values produce smoother, but
lower resolution spectral estimates.  Typical values are 4 or 8.   
.LP
Here is a simple example:
.nf
spectra_windows &Tbl{
P -0.25 1.25 4 
P -1.75 -0.25 4
}
.fi
.LP
This would produce two spectral estimates for each P phase defined
in the arrival table.  The first is a signal window that
is defined to start 0.25 seconds before the P arrival time 
and run to 1.25
seconds after this time.  The second entry is a 
preevent noise spectra from 1.75 to 0.25 seconds before the P 
arrival time.  
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
There are many.  The program is fairly verbose about problems.
Normal practice should be to keep a log file of a run of this program.
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
There probably really should be an optional -sift parameter to subset 
the input arrival table.  For now this can be done by using a 
subsetted arrival table in dbin -- a common Datascope hack.
