.TH DBSCHEMA2PROLOG 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
dbschema2prolog \- Wrap a Datascope database schema into Prolog syntax
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
dbschema2prolog schema
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
dbschema2prolog reads a Datascope database schema, putting out Prolog
unit clauses which represent the attributes and relations of the
schema. This is useful for a variety of further relational operations
on the schema. If the schema definition file is found in the current
directory, it is used. After that, paths in the SCHEMA_DIR environment
variable are searched. In addition to individual schemas, dbschema2prolog 
is able to handle combined schemas specified via the schema1:schema2 mechanism
described in dbschema(5). The resulting prolog clauses are sent to standard-out.

The time::endtime key is expressed as time_endtime. Less-than, Greater-than,
Double-Quote, and Ampersand characters are replaced by their respective
tokens &lt;, &gt;, &quot;, and &amp;.
