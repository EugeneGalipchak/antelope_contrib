Attribute fold
	Integer (4)
	Format ( "%4d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "fold > 0" )
	Description ( "number of elements used in a stack" )
	Detail {
		In stacking data we commonly used the word fold to denote the number of 
members stacked to produce an average estimate.
	}
	;

Attribute pchan
	String (8)
	Format ( "%-8s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Processing channel code" )
	Detail {
		This is a processing channel code that may or may not match the more 
common chan attribute.  It is intended most to denote  generic channel after resampling 
and/or coordinate reorientation.  The expected codes are Z,N,E,L,R,T,H, and 3C but the 
range is not currently restricted to these.
	}
	;

Attribute pwfid
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "wfid > 0" )
	Description ( "processed waveform id" )
	Detail {
		Comparable to wfid used in wfdisc, but this integer
		key is the primary index of the core processing waveform
		table and is used for association and joining of 
		ancillary tables created by all processing algorithms
		that use this schema.
	}
	;

Attribute robustt0
	Real (10)
	Format ( "%10.5f" )
	Null ( "-9999.99999" )
	Units ( "seconds" )
	Description ( "Start time of a robust stack time window" )
	Detail {
		In the robust stacking method used in array-based cross-correlation a 
separate time gate is used to compute coherence estimates used for defining a loss 
function to automatically discard noisy and inconsistent traces from the stack.  This 
special parameter defines the length of that time gate.
	}
	;

Attribute robusttwin
	Real (9)
	Format ( "%9.2f" )
	Null ( "0.00" )
	Range ( "twin > 0.0" )
	Description ( "rubust time window (s)" )
	Detail {
		In the robust stacking method used in array-based cross-corrlation we use 
a different time window for defining a coherence-based loss function used for the robust 
stacking method.  This defines the length of that time window.
	}
	;

Relation xcorbeam
	Fields ( netname chan pchan phase pwfid filter robustt0 robusttwin fold amp lddate )
	Primary ( netname pwfid )
	Foreign ( pwfid ) 
	Description ( "Saves attributes of beam computed through cross-correlation" )
	Detail {
		In generalized array processing we use cross-correlation of the stack of an 
ensemble of traces as a correlation function.  This relation holds attributes that define 
the stacked trace characteristics.  Note especially that it links to the actual array beam 
stored in the wfprocess table through the pwfid attribute.


Note the amp attribute stored here is an rms figure for the computed beam.
