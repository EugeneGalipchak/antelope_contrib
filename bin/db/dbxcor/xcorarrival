Attribute coherence
	Real (7)
	Format ( "%7.3f" )
	Null ( "-1.0" )
	Range ( "coherence>=0.0 && coherence<=1.0" )
	Description ( "coherence" )
	Detail {
		Coherence is a measure of waveform similarity commonly used in many 
signal processing algorithms.
	}
	;

Attribute pchan
	String (8)
	Format ( "%-8s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Processing channel code" )
	Detail {
		This is a processing channel code that may or may not match the more 
common chan attribute.  It is intended most to denote  generic channel after resampling 
and/or coordinate reorientation.  The expected codes are Z,N,E,L,R,T,H, and 3C but the 
range is not currently restricted to these.
	}
	;

Attribute pwfid
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "wfid > 0" )
	Description ( "processed waveform id" )
	Detail {
		Comparable to wfid used in wfdisc, but this integer
		key is the primary index of the core processing waveform
		table and is used for association and joining of 
		ancillary tables created by all processing algorithms
		that use this schema.
	}
	;

Attribute relamp
	Real (10)
	Format ( "%10.4f" )
	Null ( "-1.0")
	Range ( "relamp>0.0" )
	Description ( "Relative amplitude measurement" )
	Detail {
		In array processing one can easily compute amplitudes
		relative to an array beam.  This can be useful data and
		is worth storing in a database when measured.
	}
	;

Attribute stackwgt
	Real (6)
	Format ( "%6.3f" )
	Null ( "-1.000" )
	Range ( "wgt >= 0.0" )
	Description ( "stacking weight" )
	Detail {
		In robust stacking a weight is assigned to each member of the ensemble.
	}
	;

Attribute xcorpeak
	Real (7)
	Format ( "%7.3f" )
	Null ( "-1.0" )
	Description ( "peak correlation coefficient" )
	Detail {
		In cross-correlation the peak of the cross correlation curve is commonly 
normalized to a correlation coefficient.  This attribute is used to store the value of this 
measure of similarity of two waveforms.
	}
	;

	Primary ( sta phase pwfid )
	Description ( "Details of an arrival computed by beam cross-correlation" )
	Detail {
		Arrival times can be computed by cross correlation of a set of arrivals with 
an array beam.  Defining this process requires some attributes not found in the standard 
arrival table.  In particular, multiple processing runs could produce different results on 
the same arrival.  The idea is that when this happens this table can be used to define 
results from different processing runs that one could elect to average to produce a final 
arrival estimate.  Note the table was designed to be workable for both receiver arrays 
and virtual source arrays (common receiver gather for an ensemble of earthquakes with 
similar waveforms).
