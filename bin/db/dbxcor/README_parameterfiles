The stock parameter file for dbxcor is for it's original usage in teleseismic body
wave processing.  Two other pf files are in this directory that are never installed
in the antelope standard place, but are placed here for the record.  

dbxcor_Plocal.pf is a starting point to process P data with local earthquake data using source
arrays linked to points in space with the cluster (man cluster) program.

dbxcor_Slocal.pf is a similar file for S wave processing.  It is also a much more elaborate
example for handling three component data as the example rotates data to transverse.
That, of course, make so sense for single component data so be forewarned.
