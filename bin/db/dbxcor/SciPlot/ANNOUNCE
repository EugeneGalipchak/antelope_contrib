Announcement for SciPlot Widget, version 1.3

An update for SciPlot, my scientific cartesian and polar plotting widget,
is now available at ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/widgets/SciPlot-1.3.tar.gz

Improvements in this version include two new demo programs, including one
that plots arbitrary x/y data from text file input.  Also new in this version
are better realtime support, new convenience functions for adding data to
existing lists, and available horizontal y axis numbers (to better
conform to most scientific plot packages that I have seen).

Bug fixes include changes for several log(0) errors on degenerate lists,
better min/max determination, and fixes in my postscript generation code.

For those who haven't seen the SciPlot widget before, check out my web site
at http://www.ae.utexas.edu/~rwmcm/SciPlot.html

Here's an overview from the README:

The SciPlot Widget is a widget capable of plotting cartesian or polar graphs,
including logarithmic axes in cartesian plots.  The widget is subclassed
directly from the Core widget class, which means that it does not depend upon
any other widget set.  It may be freely used with Athena, Motif, or the
Open Look/Xview widget sets.  (There is optional Motif support that causes
the widget to be subclassed from XmPrimitive.  See the man page.)

Features provided in the widget include automatic scaling, legend drawing,
axis labeling, PostScript output, multiple plotted lines, color support, user
font specification, dashed lines, symbols drawn at points, logarithmic scales
on one or both axes in cartesian plots, and degrees or radians as angles in
polar plots.
