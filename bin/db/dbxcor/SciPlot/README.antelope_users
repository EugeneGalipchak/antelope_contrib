SciPlot is an open source package.  It was used in this program with
no alteration except for the organization of the Makefile.  SciPlot
was originally structured in typical gnu fashion.  To assimilate it
into the Antelope environment I hacked the Makefile to the form found
here.  For the original source you can search the web or look at the
original files found in Antelope contrib under 
	contrib/ext/lib/SciPlot-1.36.
