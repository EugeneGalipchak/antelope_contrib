 3 Oct 94	Changed the major/minor axis subdivision algorithm
			the negative numbers just aren't plotted.

			for selecting fonts involves logical or-ing of
			keywords, rather than standard X11 notation.
22 Sep 94	Added a "fancy" postscript option that adds border drawing
			and annotation at the top of the page (unsupported at
			the moment.  Still work to do.)

10 Sep 94	Fixed AdjustDimensions when origin was not at zero--axis
			numbers ran off of the screen
 7 Sep 94	Fixed labels--local copies weren't saved
30 Aug 94	Removed the PaperWidget subclass; all the functionality is
			duplicated in the main Plot widget source now.  This
			saves some space, since one fewer widget class is
			being initialized.

			to make sure that any text doesn't go off the page.
25 Aug 94	Added vertical text
23 Aug 94	Tic marks for major and minor axes
19 Aug 94	Added labeling for Y axis using vertical text
		Added axis labeling
		Changed fonts in Paper to be referenced by XFontStruct rather
			than Font, so metrics will be available for vtext.
		Fixed region problem in Paper.Redisplay
		Fixed problem in cartesian axis drawing


0.11:
18 Aug 94	Demo release.
		Fixed memory leak in PaperErase
		Fixed the XtLINE_NONE and XtMARKER_NONE problems
		First draft of documentation finished


0.10:

 8 Aug 94	Added legend
 5 Aug 94	Fixed problems with updating lines of data
 2 Aug 94	Added color

11 Jul 94	Major and minor axis gridlines
 8 Jul 94	Range calculations for borders and gridlines

28 Jun 94	PlotDrawAll & support functions.  Finally plotted a graph!
23 Jun 94	Different PlotLine set routines depending on data types
22 Jun 94	dumb memory allocation scheme, but saves tons of little mallocs
			in place of less frequent, but larger, mallocs
20 Jun 94	Figured out resource definitions & how to use 'em
16 Jun 94	PlotLine structure
 9 Jun 94	Still mostly waiting on Paper widget
