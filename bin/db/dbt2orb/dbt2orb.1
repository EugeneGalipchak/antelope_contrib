.SH NAME
dbt2orb \- read Datascope database rows from a database and post them to an ORB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

dbt2orb [-v] [-s subset_expr] [-l naptime] db table orb

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
dbt2orb sends a table from a Datascope database row-by-row to an
ORB.  Optionally dbt2orb can send only some subset of the database,
and can also loop forever, waiting for additional rows to be added
to the database.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-s subset_expr"
subset expression for database rows.
If specified, this subset expression will be applied to the database
table, and the remaining rows will be sent to the ORB.  If not
specified, all database rows will be sent.
.IP -v
be more verbose
.IP "-l naptime"
loop forever on the input database.  If additional rows appear, they
will be sent.  This will not work properly if both the -s option is
used and database rows are deleted while dbt2orb is running, or if
database rows are deleted and the table is subsequently crunched while
dbt2orb is running. "naptime" is the length of time, in seconds, to
wait between iterations, and must be a nonnegative integer. 
.IP db
name of the input Datascope database
.IP table
name of the table within the database which shall be sent to the ORB
.IP orb
name of the ORB to which to send the database rows
.SH NOTES
.LP
dbt2orb overwrites the scratch record of the input database
.fi
.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
Send all arrivals with times after epoch 933373361 from the 
events.arrival table to myorb:1234, with verbose reporting.
.nf

dbt2orb -v -s "time > 933373361" events arrival myorb:1234
