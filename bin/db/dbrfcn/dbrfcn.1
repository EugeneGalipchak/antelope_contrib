.SH NAME
dbrfcn \- calculates receiver functions via frequency-domain deconvolution (css3.0)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdbrfcn\fI db dbout {orid | arid:azim} sta [pf-file-prefix]\fR

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDbfrcn\fR is a database-communicative version of a frequency-domain deconvolution
routine for calculating receiver functions.  The input consists of a database 
\fIdbin\fR
with Z, N, and E, along with a few inversion parameters.  Prior to receiver
function inversion, the routine selects a time window about desired P arrival, components
are rotated into Z-R-T coordinates, records are optionally decimated, and
detrended.  Graphical display shows original 3 components, rotated horizontals,
and 3 receiver functions for Z, R, and T components (Z component RF will be
a delta-function if no filtering/stabilizing is applied).  Two records are 
output, the standard R-component receiver function (channel "rfcn") and a
T-component receiver function (channel "rf_T"). 
.LP
Deconvolution parameters are specified in a parameter file, and include a 
frequency-domain water level,
a low-pass Gaussian filter, a high-pass Butterworth filter, and
a phase shift to allow negative lag times to be seen.  
.LP
Rotation and time-window selection 
is specified for a single station and either by event (\fIorid\fR) or by
a combination of arrival pick and azimuth (\fIarid:azim\fR).  Additional
parameters are specified in a jspc-style parameter file (ending in .pf), 
including all deconvolution parameters,
the time window about P, a decimation interval, and a flag that
chooses whether to plot or not.  Sign conventions for rotated components are same as for "ahrot".
.LP
Decimation is specified by the "decimate" parameter, as an integer fraction
of the current sample rate.  Decimation is done by fourier-series truncation
with a 6-pole two-way (zero phase) Butterworth filter applied at the
new Nyquist frequency.  
.LP
Amplitudes of receiver functions are rescaled to correct for filter effects.  The scale
factor is the peak amplitude of the "Z-component" receiver function, which would be
unity if no scaling were applied.  This factor is printed to screen, and its inverse
is stored in calib field (as of 11/00).  

.SH COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIdb\fR
Input database.  Must include wfdisc, and either arrival OR origin+site tables
depending upon how the time window/rotation is specified.
.IP \fIdbout\fR
Output database.  A wfdisc table is created/added to. Data go into a relative
directory wf/rfcns/yyyy/ddd, for both radial AND tangential component receiver 
functions. 
.IP \fBorid\fR
Index pointing to description of event in the db.origin table.  If this option
is selected, the azimuth and distance to \fIsta\fR is calculated and a window
about the predicted P arrival is output.  
.IP \fBarid:azim\fR
Another way of selecting the window/rotation parameters:  uses the arrival 
time \fIarid\fR instead of the predicted P time. Also uses the specified azimuth
\fIazim\fR instead of a calculated one for rotation.

.IP \fBsta\fR
The station to be processed.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
TAUP_PATH is used to specify travel-time calculation for P.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
.IP \fBpf-file-prefix\fR
The name of a parameter file (ending in  .pf) that contains other parameters.
A default file is hardwired, in the src directory. Defaults exist for any missing
parameters []. Parameters include:
.IP \fItstart\fR
Start time of output window desired, relative to arid or predicted P. [-10.]
.IP \fItend\fR
End time of output window desired, relative to arid or predicted P. [50.]
.IP \fIgaussfreq\fR
Corner frequency, in Hz, for low-pass Gaussian filter. [.25]
.IP \fIhpfreq\fR
Corner frequency, in Hz, for high-pass 6-pole two-way (zero phase) Butterworth filter. [.02]
.IP \fIphaseshift\fR
Time, in s, to shift receiver functions [10.]
.IP \fIwaterlevel\fR
Minimum allowed fraction of peak spectral amplitude; frequency-domain points
with lower amplitudes are replaced by waterlevel*peak-amplitude, retaining 
phase. [.01]
.IP \fIdecimate\fR
Decimation interval: an integer fraction of the current sample rate to use
as the new sample rate.  A value of 0 or 1 results in no decimation. [8]
.IP \fIgraphics\fR
A flag; 1 for graphical output and interactive questionning, 0 otherwise. [1]

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Unclear what happens if more than one Z, N, or E channel exists for a 
given station-time combination.  
.LP
This method has all of the problems typically associated with frequency-domain
deconvolutions.
