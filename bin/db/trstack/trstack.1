.TH TRSTACK 1 "4/24/96"
.SH NAME
trstack  \- stacks selected traces in a css3.0 database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBtrstack \fIdbin dbout subset imode [-azmin=xx] [-azmax=xx] [-delmin=xx] [-delmax=xx] [pf-file]\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A simple brute stacking program.  A subset of data in a css3.0 database, user
entered, are stacked by aligning them up by their first sample.  The stack and
the RMS variation about the stack are output to a new/same database.  Output
channel name for stack has "_ss" appended to it, and channel name for RMS has
an "_er" appended.

.SH COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
.IP \fBdb\fR
Input database.  Must include wfdisc tables.
.IP \fBdbout\fR  
Output database.  A wfdisc table is created/added to. Data go into a relative
directory wf/rfstack/yyyy/ddd.   
.IP \fBsubset\fR
Logic string sent to dbselect that selects the waveforms to be processed, for
example 'chan=="rfcn"' or 'chan=="rfcn" && sta=="ORGH"'.
.IP \fBimode\fR
0 for regular, 1 to not generate graphics.
.IP \fBazmin=xx\fR
Only use back-azimuths greater than xx
.IP \fBazmax=xx\fR
Only use back-azimuths less than xx
.IP \fBdelmin=xx\fR
Only use distances greater than xx
.IP \fBdelmax=xx\fR
Only use distances less than xx
.IP \fBpf-file\fR
Reads in a parameter file with filter parameters:  hpfreq, lpfreq

.SH EXAMPLE
trstack dbtest junk 'chan == "rfcn"' 0
.LP
A new database table, junk.wfdisc, is made with a stack of the rfcn traces.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Current stacking is pretty primitive, no mechanism exists for aligning by pick, absolute time, etc.
