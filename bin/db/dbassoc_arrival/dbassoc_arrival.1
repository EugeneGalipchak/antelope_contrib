.SH NAME
dbassoc_arrival \- associate arrivals with an origin table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
dbassoc_arrival [-p delta_p] [-s delta_s] arrival_db origin_db
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
dbassoc_arrival attempts to associate p and s phase arrivals
from one database, arrival_db,  with origins in a second (distinct) database
origin_db.  For each origin, it looks for matching arrivals.
If matching arrivals are found, that origin is added to the 
arrival_db origin table, and assoc table entries are made in the
arrival_db assoc table.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-p delta_p"
.br
You may specify the maximum p-arrival residual; the default is 3.0 seconds.
.IP "-s delta_s"
.br
You may specify the maximum s-arrival residual; the default is 10.0 seconds.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP TAUP_TABLE
.br
This specifies the travel time table used.

.IP "Can't open database \fIorigin_dbname\fR"
.IP "Origin table has no records."
.IP "Arrival table has no records."
.IP "Site table has no records."
Can't read some necessary information.
.IP "Can't get new orid id"
Probably permissions don't permit writing to the lastid table.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
Dbassoc_arrival will only match arrivals with iphase starting with 'P'
or 'S', and only matches against first P and S arrivals, not later
arrivals.
.LP
The origin table records are copied almost verbatim from the 
origin_db to the arrival_db; only orid is changed.  Commid's
are copied as is, but may be be dangling references in the 
new database.
.LP
There are no station elevation correction factors added into
the arrival time calculations.
