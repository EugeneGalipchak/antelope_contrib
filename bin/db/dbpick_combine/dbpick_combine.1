.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdbpick_combine\fP is intended to make waveform review of data from two 
distinct database easier by combining a subset of each input database and
viewing it in dbpick.  This assumes that the two input databases are related
in some fashion and have data from overlapping time windows.  For instance, 
\fIdb1\fP may contain your seismic waveform data while \fIdb2\fP may contain
your state of health data (mass positions, system voltage, etc.).  Rather 
than starting two separate instances of \fBdbpick\fP, you can create a view 
that shows all traces in the same dbpick window.
.LP
\fBdbpick_combine\fP subsets the arrival, site, and wfdisc tables 
from the input databases, \fIdb1\fP and \fIdb2\fP and makes them available
in the output database used for \fBdbpick\fP.  You must have a site 
table available for \fIdb1\fP if you are using the -nearby option.  
No attempts are made to clean up duplicate picks or "del" picks from 
the input database. The arrival table is not necessary.  
.LP
A dbpick waveform window is generated with the dbpick
prompt appearing in the same window where you run the \fBdbpick_combine\fP
command.  Make sure you type "quit" at the dbpick prompt rather than 
using Cntrl-C or the window manager close button on the waveform display 
window.  Not following this step may result in the temporary database 
cleanup failing.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
verbose
.IP "-chan channel_subset"
A basic channel subset to be applied to the arrival and wfdisc tables of
\fIdb1\fP and \fIdb2\fP.  Examples of valid subsets include:  
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
.ne 7

/BHZ/
/BH[ZNE]|VM./
/L.*/

.fi
.ft R
.in
At the moment, negative subsets are not allowed.
.IP "-start start_time"
Start time of data to be reviewed.  All data after this start_time is
selected from the wfdiscs and arrivals (if available) of \fIdb1\fP 
and \fIdb2\fP.
.IP "-end end_time"
End time of data to be reviewed.  All data before this end_time is  
selected from the wfdiscs and arrivals (if available) of \fIdb1\fP 
and \fIdb2\fP.  This is sometimes necessary for large real-time databases.
See BUGS and CAVEATS below.
.IP "-keep outputdb"
Keeps all temporary databases and uses outputdb for the combined view.  
This database is kept after quitting dbpick. 
.IP "-sta station_subset"
Subset the input databases so that only the station_subset channels are 
available. Examples of valid subsets include:  
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
.ne 7

/A04A/
/N0.A|M1.A/
/L.*/

.fi
.ft R
.in
Either the -sta or -nearby option must be specified.
.IP "-nearby sta"
Subset the database so that only stations close to sta are 
in the output view.  This station must be in the input database
\fIdb1\fP.  The default is to collect all stations within 2 degrees
of sta.  Use -dist to change the default.  Instead of specifying a 
specific station, you can use a coordinate.  This negates the need
for \fIdb1\fP to have a site table.
.IP "-dist distance"
With -nearby, collect stations that are within distance range of the
station (or coordinates) specified with the -nearby option.

.LP
Temporary database files are also created in the directory of the 
input databases.  They look something like: dbpick_combine19166 
and should be automatically removed upon exit of the program
unless -keep is used. See BUGS AND CAVEATS!
.SH ENVIRONMENT
You must be able to run X-windows programs. 
.SH EXAMPLE
.SS "Nearby station mode"
.IP \(bu
Collect the BH* and VM* channels of all stations within 
1 degree of station A04A starting after 2006-245.
.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf
.ne 2

%\fBdbpick_combine -nearby "A04A" -dist 1.0 -chan "/BH.|VM./" \
	-start 2006245:00:00:00  db/usarray db2/usarray2 \fP
.fi
.in
.ft R
.IP \(bu
Collect all BH* channels within 2 degrees (default) of 40N 115W.
.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf
.ne 2

%\fBdbpick_combine -nearby "40:-115" -chan "/BH.*/" \
	db/usarray db2/usarray2 \fP
.fi
.in
.ft R
.SS "Station mode"
.IP \(bu
Collect all BH* channels for stations A04A, B04A, C04A, and A03A. 
.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf
.ne 4

%\fBdbpick_combine -sta "/A04A|B04A|C04A|A03A/" -chan "/BH./" \

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
I have seen errors like:
.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf
.ne 7

2007-234 16:25:49 dbcp *log*: Bad record id 81 in db pointer
2007-234 16:25:49 dbcp *log*: bad db type in dbputv

.fi
.in
.ft R
when this program is run on large real-time databases.  I have not been
able to reliably reproduce the error yet.  The only work-around I can 
suggest is that you use -end with a time before the most recent time 
in the wfdisc table.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
This was "in shop" code that I am freeing into the world.  It may not 
do what you want it to do, but it worked for me.  Requests for upgrades 
and changes may be taken into consideration, but action on them may take
a long while.
.LP
No support yet for expanded subsetting capabilities (i.e. sta !~/A0.*/ 
&& sta=~/A1.*/).  I am considering this and may end up re-writing code 
in such a way that may not be backward compatible with the -sta and -nearby
options.  
.LP
Better error message and check is needed if the -sta subset is for a station 
that is not in the site table.
.LP
Can leave detritus database files and descriptors around if program exits 
abnormally.
.LP
Some of the subsets can take a significant amount of time if the database 
tables are large.  Have patience.
.LP
There are some rm commands in this script.  Bad choice of input dbs could cause an important database to be removed.  Please do not use /tmp/db1.wfdisc or /tmp/db2.wfdisc as either of your input databases.  Save a backup of the input dbs
if you are paranoid like me.
.LP
The -keep option is untested at the moment....
