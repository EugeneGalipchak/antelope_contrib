.SH NAME
DBTC \- database time correction routine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

dbtc [-p parfile] [-t stime] [-v] gdb:gnet:gsta:gch bdb:bnet:bsta:bch

correctdt [-t stime] bdb

.fi
.SH DBTC
Seismic networks can have a clock problem and as a result produce
data with incorrect time. \fBdbtc\fP finds a time correction for 
seismic data from such a network (\fIbad data\fR) by doing 
cross correlation with data from a network that does not have a time
problem (\fIgood data\fR). A  (\fIbad data\fR) must be specified in
form of \fBbdb:bnet:bsta:bch\fP, where
.nf
     bdb  => db name of data with a bad time
     bdb  => network name of data with a bad time
     bdb  => station name of data with a bad time
     bdb  => channel name of data with a bad time
.fi
and a (\fIgood data\fR) must be specified in form of \fBgdb:gnet:gsta:gch\fP,
where
.nf

     gdb  => db name of data with a good time
     gdb  => network name of data with a good time
     gdb  => station name of data with a good time
     gdb  => channel name of data with a good time
.fi

.LP
\fBDBTC\fP makes a \fItcorrection\fR table with a \fIbdb.tcorrection\fR name and
with a following fields:
.nf

   time  tcor gnet gsta gchan gsamprate bnet bsta bchan bsamprate lddate
.fi

A \fItcor\fR is a time correction which should be added to a time of
a \fIbad data\fR.
.LP
If \fIbad data\fR and \fIgood data\fR have a different sampling rate \fBdbtc\fP
does a re-sampling of a \fIbad data\fR.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-p parfile"
Specified a name of a parameter file which will be used by \fBdbtc\fP.
Deafult name is \fIdbtc.pf\fR.
.IP "-t stime"
Specify a time of \fBbad data\fP from which start to do a cross correlation.
By default start at data start time.
.IP "-v"
Be more verbose.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.LP
\fBdbct\fP uses a parameter file, which has the following parameters:
.IP "data_segment_window"
a whole data series will be split on segments by \fIdata_segment_window\fR seconds
and \fItcor\fR will be calculated for each such segment.
.IP "correlation_window"
a data window in seconds which is used in cross correlation computations.
.IP "allowed_time_err_offset"
a maximum allowed time error in seconds.

.SH CORRECTDT
\fBcorrectdt\fP reads \fItcorrection\fR table and fixes time in 
\fIwfdisc, arrival\fR tables. If data is in mini-seed format it fixes time
in SEED headers as well.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-m srcid"
a \fItcorrection\fR record which \fInet_sta_chan\fR key matches  the   regular
expression \fIsrcid\fR will be used in a time correction procedure.   
.IP "-t stime"
Start fixing time in \fIbad data\fR set at \fIstime\fR. 
.SH EXAMPLE 
.LP
Find a time correction for anza network. Bad data is \fIdata/anza:AZ:PFO:BHZ\fR
and good data is \fInrdc/ida:II:PFO:shz\fR
.nf

dbtc nrdc/ida:II:PFO:shz data/anza:AZ:PFO:BHZ

correctdt data/anza
