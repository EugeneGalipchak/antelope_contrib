.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The mwap program is a software tool that performs a novel form 
of coherent waveform processing.  The current version is 
exclusively designed for application to three-component seismic
arrays.  It does plane wave processing so it is NOT applicable to 
data from events inside an array.  It is designed for large
aperture broadband array recordings of teleseisms but will
work equally well on three-component small aperture, high frequency arrays.
The program simultaneously estimates five sets of observables:
(1) the slowness (phase velocity) vector of a best fit plane wave, 
(2) static time shifts relative to this best fit plane wave, 
(3) amplitude statics of amplitudes relative to the array
stack at each station, (4) particle motion ellipse estimates for
every station in the array, and (5) an array average particle motion
estimate.   
.LP
The mwap builds on a unique concept of multiwavelets that are 
closely akin to multitaper spectral estimates.  The essence of
their use is that multiwavelets should be thought of as a set
of narrowband filters with optimal resolution in the time and
frequency domains.  That is, they have the narrowest possible
bandwidth for a specified time duration or vice versa.  The
major use of these special functions in this program is to 
measure phase.  Most of the manipulations in the program, however,
involve phase measurements made on transient signals by using
complex pairs of wavelets that are similar in form to windowed
sine and cosine functions.   The "multi" modifier comes from
the fact that multiple, orthogonal functions are used to produce
independent estimates in the same band.  This permits robust
averaging in an attempt to make estimates more stable and simultaneously
provide objective error estimates of the resulting parameters.
.LP
Seismic data are read from an input css3.0 database.  The program
looks at the event, origin, assoc, arrival, wfdisc, site, and 
sitechan tables and the integrity of the database is assumed.  
The actual reads use the current Antelope trace library so whatever
datatypes the trace library supports can be read by this program.
The program will attempt to process the entire database using
evid-based grouping.  Use a sift parameter if subsets of the
data are desired.
.LP
It is important to recognize that this program is not intended
as a raw processing module. It expects to be handed a set of 
associated arrival picks are that are within a half-cycle of being
correct at the lowest frequency present in the data.  It will
almost certainly yield total garbage if the picks are not 
reasonable.  Extensive use of robust estimators help some in
stability, but the number of free parameters seem to render the results
somewhat unpredictable in the presence of strong outliers.  
.LP
The major input parameters to this program are through a parameter file 
that defaults to mwap.pf.  The list of parameters is long and 
described in detail in a related html document (see below).
The major output of the program is a series of extension tables
to css3.0 called:  mwslow (slowness vector estimates),
mwtstatics (time statics table), mwastatics (amplitude statics
table), mwpm (particle motion estimate table), mwsnr (holds signal to 
noise ratio estimates for different analysis bands), and mwavgamp 
(array average amplitude estimates in each band).  
.SH COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
.IP db
Datascope database name to process.
.IP -phase
This parameter allows specification of an alternative phase to the default P.  
The trailing character is a phase name is use to distinguish P and S 
phases.  e.g. S is assumed to be an S wavefield at the array.
The distinction is important because S phases are rotated
differently and S velocities are used to compute elevation statics
instead of P velocities. 
.IP -sift
The given expression is applied to a basic arrival time view 
(event, origin, assoc, arrival) to reduce the data to be processed.
For example, to process only evid 245, use -sift "evid==245".
.IP -pf
Use pfname as the parameter file instead of the default mwap.pf
.SH FILES
.LP
Requires schema extension MWavelet1.3 to be stored in an accessible 
place and be defined in the database descriptor.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
Look for current html documentation at 
http://aesn.geology.indiana.edu/aug/aug.html.  The detailed desription
of parameters for mwap is under construction. 
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.nf
mwapbavg(1), mwtransform(3), mwstatistics(3) and html documentation 
which is much more complete.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The fundamental tradeoff between the estimated slowness vector
and a best fit plane through a surface of residuals makes the
convergence of this algorithm less stable than one might wish.
If problems are found in a given event, try checking the picks
and reprocessing that event.
