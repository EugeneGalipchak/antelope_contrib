.TH CLEANUP_DBDIR 1 2003/05/09 "Antelope Contrib SW" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
cleanup_dbdir \- remove waveforms left over by previous runs of rtdbclean 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
cleanup_dbdir [-v] [-n] [-d days] dbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
cleanup_dbdir removes old waveforms that are not referenced in the wfdisc table. It is a good idea to run the program periodically as a cron job if you have half-emptied directories with waveforms.
.IP "-v" 
verbose flag
.IP "-n"
simulates execution, but does not remove waveforms.
.IP "-d days"
leave n days of waveforms before end of database. Defaults to 7 days if not specified.
.IP "dbname"
Name of database. This argument is required

.SH EXAMPLE
The following entry in rtexec.pf removes all wafevorms (and empty directories) taht are not referenced in $DB.wfdisc, but leaves 2 days worth of data before the oldest entry in the table.
.nf
cleanup_dbdir UTC 0 0 * * * cleanup_dbdir -v -d 2 $DB
.fi

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The program uses dbquery(dbTABLE_DIRMANE) to find out where waveforms could be and removes starting there all \fBunreferenced\fP files and directories. Make sure that you have no other files there!
You should try the program first with the -n flag (and check the output for suspicious entries) before installing it as a cronjob.
