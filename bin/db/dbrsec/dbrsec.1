.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dbrsec
makes a PostScript output file that contains a record section
style display of either multiple channels for a single event
or multiple events for a single channel. The output file
name is automatically created and begins with \fIdbrsec.\fP and ends with \fI.ps\fP.
.SH COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
.TP 15
\fIdb\fP
The name of the input database.
This argument is required.
.TP 15
\fI-sc sta:chan\fP
The station and channel codes.
Either this argument or the \fI-orid\fP argument
is required. If this argument is specified, then
the record section is for a single channel over
multiple events.
.TP 15
\fI-orid orid:chan\fP
The event orid value and the channel code.
Either this argument or the \fI-sc\fP argument
is required. If this argument is specified, then
the record section is for a single event over
multiple stations.
chan may be either a single channel code (e.g., \fIBHZ\fP),
or a Datascope expression involving chan and surrounded by
parens (e.g., \fI(chan =~/.*[1Z]/)\fP.
.TP 15
\fI-top top\fP
The distance in degrees at the top of the plot.
.TP 15
\fI-bot bot\fP
The distance in degrees at the bottom of the plot.
.TP 15
\fI-tstart tstart\fP
The start time for the display. This is in seconds relative to
the event origin time.
.TP 15
\fI-twin twin\fP
The time window in seconds for the display.
.TP 15
\fI-filter filter\fP
A filter specification. This filter is applied to
the waveform before it is plotted.
The \fIfilter\fP specification is a character string like
"BW 0.1 5 1.0 5" which would be a 5 order Butterworth filter
with a low corner frequency of 0.1 Hz and a high corner
frequency of 1.0 Hz. Note that specifications such as
this with embedded blanks must be quoted in the command line.
This argument is optional and if not specified, then
no filtering is done.
.TP 15
\fI-sift sift\fP
An optional Datascope sifting string.
.TP 15
\fI-clip {on|off}\fP
Apply plot clipping flag.
.TP 15
\fI-vred vred\fP
If specified, then apply time scale velocity reduction.
This is specified in km/sec.
.TP 15
\fI-gain gain\fP
This is a gain factor applied to the plot amplitude of
each trace. It defaults to 1.0.
.TP 15
\fI-amp amp\fP
The amplitude scale factor in data units per inch.
The data units are defined within the database and are
typically something like nm/sec.

.in 2c
%\fB dbcp -d /opt/antelope/data/db/demo2/demo2 .\fP
%\fB dbrsec demo2 -orid 1940:BHZ -top 0.0 -bot 20 -twin 600\fP

.SH BUGS AND CAVEATS
The \fIoptions\fP -\fItop\fP, -\fIbot\fP, -\fItwin\fP are required.
.LP
The database should be in the current directory, otherwise
the program is not able to save the resulting postscript
file.
