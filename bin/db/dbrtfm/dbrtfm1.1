Schema dbrtfm1.1
	Description ( "Man-page tracking database" )
	Detail {
		The dbrtfm schema allows man-pages for all components
		of a Unix-based software system to be tracked by

		which man pages have been thoroughly read through and 
		when. This allows a complete review of the 
		existing package capabilities.
