.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBdbrtfm\fP application is a tool designed to help one progressively
read the full manual-page set for Antelope.

Upon first execution, \fBdbrtfm\fP builds a database of all available man
pages so the user can track which ones have been read. The location of this
database is set by the parameter \fIdbrtfm_database\fP in the parameter file
(the default is in the user's home directory); 
the database schema is \fIdbrtfm1.0\fP.

Currently, the next unread man-page is chosen from those listed in the tracking
database. If desired, an optional man-page name may be specified on
the command line, in which case the first available man page with that name
is shown. If a man-page section is specified also, that further constrains
the selection. If the \fIignore_contrib\fP parameter is set to true
in the parameter file, man pages from the Antelope contributed-code
distribution are ignored when the next unread manual
page is chosen automatically.
If the \fI+n\fP argument is used, where \fIn\fP is an integer,
the specified number of man-pages are skipped past the next available
man page, when nothing else is specified on the command line (i.e. when
choosing the next unread man page automatically).

If the \fI-S\fP option is used, a summary is printed of the number of
man-pages read so far (assuming those with NULL value for the \fItime\fP
field have not yet been read).

\fBdbrtfm\fP sets the chosen file to the perl value \fI$file\fP, then eval's the
perl-code given in the \fIshowman\fP parameter of the parameter file, which
should provide some way to display (or email, or print, or whatever is
desired) the specified man-page on your system. One may specify
several different modes of display in the \fIshowman\fP parameter; barring
overrides with the command-line arguments, the default is set by the
\fIdefault_mode\fP parameter.

After the \fBdbrtfm\fP run, \fBdbrtfm\fP asks the user to mark whether 
the man page has been read. 

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -l
When automatically choosing the man-page to read, 
instead of choosing the next one in the list,
choose the longest unread man-page.
.IP -s
When automatically choosing the man-page to read, 
instead of choosing the next one in the list,
choose the shortest unread man-page.
.IP -t
use a tk GUI for answering whether man-page is read. 
.IP -q
Query whether a man-page specified on the command-line has been read or not
.IP "-m mode"
Display man page in an alternate \fImode\fP instead of the default
.IP "+n"
Skip \fIn\fP man-pages when choosing the next available unread man-page.
This can be useful if the next available unread man-page is prohibitively
long for the amount of time available before all approved electronic
devices must be shut off.
.IP -S
Print a summary of progress reading the Antelope man-pages

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

dbrtfm: \fBdbrtfm\fP: initializing tracking database '/Users/kent/rtfmdb'

dbrtfm: Build rtfm database '/Users/kent/rtfmdb' from scratch?

(\fBdbrtfm\fP asks for confirmation before rebuilding the man-page 
database; this can avert
the small mess when one accidentally uses the default parameter file
instead of one that one has customized).

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The netscape and mozilla configurations of the parameter file do not open or
raise the netscape/mozilla windows if they are iconified or buried.

The command-line specification of man-pages works only for the actual
names under which they are stored. One cannot, for example, use the command-line
specification to call up the man page for something that is actually just
a link to another man page.

The line count for manual pages is based on the number of lines in the 
nroff source file, rather than the number of lines in the formatted 
text seen in a standard pager utility, which can be a bit misleading. This 
accounting strategy is a good approximation in bulk, however may be a 
small mistake (defensible, though, since line count is dependent on the 
exact configuration of the display utility).

The matching done to figure out the author during initial database 
build is very, perhaps overly simplistic.
