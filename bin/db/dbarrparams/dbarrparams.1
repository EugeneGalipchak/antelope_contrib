.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dbarrparams
will compute specified arrival parameters and save these parameters in
the arrival table of the CSS relational database.
The parameters that can be computed are polarization parameters (azimuth,
incidence angle and rectilinearity), amplitude and period, first motion
and signal to noise ratio. A filter can be specified that will be applied
to the waveforms before the measurements are made.
This program will only work with v. 3.0 of the CSS schema.
.SH COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
.TP 15
\fIdbname\fP
The name of the subject database. The database name is defined as the 
file name of one of the flat relation files without the .relname suffix.
For example, if the .wfdisc relation file name is ./foo.wfdisc then ./foo
is the database name. 
This argument is required.
.TP 15
\fI-pol tlead_pol tlag_pol\fP
If these arguments are specified, then 3-component polarization analysis
is performed to determine azimuth, incidence angle and rectilinearity
using the covariance matrix method. The arguments \fItlead_pol\fP and
\fItlag_pol\fP specify the time window around the arrival to be used
for computing the polarization parameters where \fItlead_pol\fP is
the number of seconds before the arrival for the start of the window
and \fItlag_pol\fP is the number of seconds after the arrival for the 
end of the window. NOTE: 3-component clusters are determined automatically
by matching station codes and everything but the last character of the
channel codes. The last character of the channel codes must be 'Z', 'N', or 'E'
(or 'z', 'n', 'e') and these are assumed to be correct
(i.e. the program does not look into the sitechan table to check the
actual sensor orientation but assumes that Z is up, N is north and
E is east). Thus numerical channel codes such as '01', '02', '03'
WILL NOT WORK with this program as it is currently written. 
.TP 15
\fI-ap tmin_ap tmax_ap\fP
If these arguments are specified, then amplitude-period measurements
are made. The arguments \fItmin_ap\fP and \fItmax_ap\fP specify the
time window around the arrival to be used for determining the
amplitude and period where \fItmin_ap\fP is the number of seconds
after the arrival for the start of the window and \fItmax_ap\fP is the
number of seconds after the arrival for the end of the window.
.TP 15
\fI-fm tmin_fm tmax_fm\fP
If these arguments are specified, then first motion measurements
are made. The arguments \fItmin_fm\fP and \fItmax_fm\fP specify the
time window around the arrival to be used for determining the
first motion where \fItmin_fm\fP is the number of seconds
after the arrival for the start of the window and \fItmax_fm\fP is the
number of seconds after the arrival for the end of the window.
.TP 15
\fI-snr tlead_snr tlag_snr\fP
If these arguments are specified, then signal to noise measurements
are made.  The arguments \fItlead_snr\fP and
\fItlag_snr\fP specify the time window around the arrival to be used
for computing the signal and noise windows where \fItlead_snr\fP is
the number of seconds before the arrival for the noise window
and \fItlag_snr\fP is the number of seconds after the arrival for the 
signal window.
.TP 15
\fI-filter type lco hco lord hord tpad\fP
If these arguments are specified, then all waveforms are filtered
prior to any of the other measurements. The type of filter is
specified by an integer argument, \fItype\fP, which is 1 for a 
minimum phase Butterworth filter and 2 for a zero phase Butterworth
filter. The arguments \fIlco hco lord hord tpad\fP are, respectively,
the low corner frequency in Hz, the high corner frequency in Hz,
the order of the highpass stage, the order of the lowpass stage,
and the time pad in seconds for minimizing the filter transient.
Values of 0 for corner frequencies or orders will eliminate the
appropriate stages.
.SH BUGS AND CAVEATS
I offer this program in source code form, as is, with no guarantee
that it works properly. I am doing this because many folks have
asked for this old program. 
This is a very old program that I wrote in
my University research days, now many years ago. Any memory I may have
had about this code has since recycled many times. In other words, the
source code is my ONLY contribution. I will provide no support for this program,
other than the source code. That's what open source is supposed to be all
about, isn't it? So please don't e-mail me questions. Also, please feel
free to make any modifications, especially bug fixes, and check them back
into the contributed repository. D. Harvey
