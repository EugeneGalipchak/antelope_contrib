.SH NAME
dbproject_covariance\- compute confidence-ellipse from covariance matrix
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
dbproject_covariance \[-v\] \[-c conf\] dbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
dbproject_covariance reads the covariance matrix out of the origerr 
table of a CSS3.0 or related database. A confidence ellipse is then 
calculated (smajax, sminax, and strike, as well as sdepth and stime)
based on a Chi-squared model and the specified confidence level. If 
no confidence level is specified, dbproject_covariance uses 0.683, 
i.e. 1 sigma. If any of smajax, sminax, strike, sdepth, and stime are 
non-null, the origerr row is skipped. If any of the covariance-matrix
elements are null, the origerr row is skipped. dbproject_covariance 
also uses ndef and dtype out of the origin table to determine the number 
of degrees of freedom of the solution.

When the projected confidence region has been computed, the origerr 
table is updated with the new smajax, sminax, sdepth, stime, strike, and 
conf values.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The number of degrees of freedom is based on ndef and dtype. If array 
data are included (azimuth and slowness information in addition to 
arrival-time), there are more than one degree of freedom added per incoming 
phase, so using the number of defining phases is not exact. To 
do this properly, the timedef, azdef, and slodef fields would have to be 
examined in the assoc table. This has not been done in the current program.

There is another way to calculate the confidence level, namely with 
an F-distribution statistical model rather than the chi-squared. In 
principle this would be possible however it would probably require 
a recomputation of residuals from the assoc table.
