Attribute gridname
	String (15)
        Format ( "%-15s" )
        Null ( "-" )
        Description ( "Name attached to a coordinate grid mesh" )
        Detail {
                Several contexts require geographical 2d or 3d 
		grids.  This attribute ties a name to a name to 
		a grid that is a useful key for many tables defining
		such an entity.
        }
        ;

Attribute gridid
        Integer (8)
        Format ( "%8d" )
        Null ( "-1" )
        Range ( "gridid > 0" )
        Description ( "grid id index" )
        Detail {
		Spatial grids are conveniently indexed with a single
		integer.  This allows the structure of the grid to be
		defined as desired.  This index is also a convenient
		key if the grid is defined in a database table instead
		of being stored on disk.
        }
        ;

Attribute pmelrun
	String (5)
        Format ( "%-5s" )
        Null ( "-" )
        Description ( "Run code for dbpmel program" )
        Detail {
		The dbpmel program builds several special output
		tables.  To allow multiple runs with different 
		parameters against a common database we need this
		key in some of these tables.
        }
        ;
Attribute tsc
	Real ( 10 )
	Format ( "%10.3lf" )
	Units ( "Seconds" )
	Description ( "Travel time station correction" )
        Null ( "-999.0000" )
	Detail {
		Station corrections are corrections added to a computed
		travel time that are tagged to a particular receiver 
		position.  
		}
	;

Attribute tscref
	Real ( 10 )
	Format ( "%10.3lf" )
	Units ( "Seconds" )
	Description ( "Reference station correction" )
        Null ( "-999.0000" )
	Detail {
		Station corrections are corrections added to a computed
		travel time that are tagged to a particular receiver 
		position.  A reference station correction is a concept
		used by pmel to denote a correction formed as the 
		difference between two model realizations.  Normally
		this would be a difference T3d - T1d where T3d is a
		time computed for a 3D model and T1d is time computed
		for a 1D reference model.  
		}
	;
	
Attribute tscbias
	Real ( 10 )
	Format ( "%10.3lf" )
	Units ( "Seconds" )
	Description ( "Bias component of station correction" )
        Null ( "-999.0000" )
	Detail {
		Station corrections are corrections added to a computed
		travel time that are tagged to a particular receiver 
		position.  A reference/bias station correction is a concept
		used by pmel to denote a correction used as a bias
		contribute.  That is, a bias is applied that is derived
		from the reference corrections (tsref) and this is the
		component of tsc derived from tsref.   
		}

Relation gridscor
	Fields (
		sta phase gridname gridid pmelrun tsc tscref tscbias lddate )
	Primary ( sta phase gridname gridid pmelrun )

	Detail {
		This is this one of two primary output tables of dbpmel.
		It contains the station corrections computed for each
		station/phase combination.
