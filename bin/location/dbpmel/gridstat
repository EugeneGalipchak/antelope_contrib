Attribute gridname
	String (15)
        Format ( "%-15s" )
        Null ( "-" )
        Description ( "Name attached to a coordinate grid mesh" )
        Detail {
                Several contexts require geographical 2d or 3d 
		grids.  This attribute ties a name to a name to 
		a grid that is a useful key for many tables defining
		such an entity.
        }
        ;

Attribute gridid
        Integer (8)
        Format ( "%8d" )
        Null ( "-1" )
        Range ( "gridid > 0" )
        Description ( "grid id index" )
        Detail {
		Spatial grids are conveniently indexed with a single
		integer.  This allows the structure of the grid to be
		defined as desired.  This index is also a convenient
		key if the grid is defined in a database table instead
		of being stored on disk.
        }
        ;

Attribute pmelrun
	String (5)
        Format ( "%-5s" )
        Null ( "-" )
        Description ( "Run code for dbpmel program" )
        Detail {
		The dbpmel program builds several special output
		tables.  To allow multiple runs with different 
		parameters against a common database we need this
		key in some of these tables.
        }
        ;

Attribute sswrodgf
	Real ( 15 )
	Format ( "%15.6lg" )
	Range ( "sswrodgf>0.0" )
	Description ( "Normalized sum of squared weighted residuals" )
        Null ( "-999.0000" )
	Detail {
		Proper statistical description of a misfit statistic
		for data with variable uncertainties uses a weighting
		of e_i/sigma_i where sigma_i is the estimated uncertainty
		in e_i.  sswrodgf is the sum of squared weighted residuals
		divided by the number of degrees of freedom.  This is 
		a normalized form of rms used with this type of weighting.
		}
	;

Attribute ndgf
	Integer (4)
	Format ( "%4d" )
	Null ("-1")
	Range ( "ndgf>=0")
	Description ( "Number of degrees of freedom" )
	Detail {
		Many statistical metrics require a degrees of freedom
		parameter which is typically number of data - number
		of parameters.  Other contexts may use this to mean
		something different that is consistent with the words.
		}
	;

Relation gridstat
	Fields ( gridname gridid pmelrun sswrodgf ndgf sdobs lddate )
	Primary ( gridname gridid pmelrun )
	Foreign ( gridid )
	Description ( "Location misfit statistics for multievent location" )
	Detail {
		Used by dbpmel to save misfit statistics for different
		grid points.  These statistics are ensemble averages for
		all events associated with a given grid point defined
		by gridid and gridname. 
	}
