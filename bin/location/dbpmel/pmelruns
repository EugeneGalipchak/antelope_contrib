        Description ( "Run code for dbpmel program" )
        Detail {
		The dbpmel program builds several special output
		tables.  To allow multiple runs with different 
		parameters against a common database we need this
		key in some of these tables.

Attribute vmodel3d

        Description ( "3D velocity model name" )
        Detail {
                This character string identifies the velocity model of
the
                earth used to compute the travel times of seismic
phases.
                These are required for event location (if phase is
                defining) or for computing travel-time residuals.
		This is a companion to vmodel used to tag 3D reference
		models in dbpmel and related programs.

		This is a special working table for dbpmel that is 
		used to save the large set of parameters that control
		it's operation.  The run code, pmelrun, is used as a
		key in several other tables to allow multiple runs
		to be stored in a single database.
