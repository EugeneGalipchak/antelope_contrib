.SH NAME
taup_convert - Uses taup library to produce travel time tables that can be used by genloc location programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
taup_convert  phase [-d0 x -ddelta x -z0 x -dz x -ndelta n -nz n]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Simple utility program that utilizes the taup library (see tttaup(3))
routines to produce parameter file tables used by genloc library
routines for the "uniform table interpolation" travel time function
(see genloc_intro(3)).  
This table is written to stdout.
The only required argument is "phase"
which is the seismic phase the table is to be computed for.  
This must be a phase the taup library knows about, which currently 
excludes some exotic teleseismic arrivals.  It can
also be a "generic" phase like P or S, which 
means it will select the first arrival P and S at any distances.
.LP
Options are
as follows:
.IP -d0
First distance value (in degrees) to start table at (default = 0.0).
.IP -ddelta
Distance increment (in degrees) between table entries (default = 1.0).
.IP -z0
First source depth value for table (default = 0.0).
.IP -dz
Source depth increment (in km) between table entries (default = 5.0).
.IP -ndelta
Number of table entries in distance (default=180).
.IP -nz
Number of table entries in depth (default=100).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
All errors are written to stderr.  The complete list is:
.LP
Unrecognized argument->xxx ---   Error in argument lists
.LP
Fatal:  cannot alloc memory  ---  Almost surely means -nz was given
as an absurdly large value.
.LP
Fatal error trying to call taup library  --- The taup calculation function
returned a nondescript error.  
.LP
taup_convert (Warning):  tt_taup_slowness found no arrivals at delta =xxxxxxx, depth = xxxxxxxx  ---  Usually means you asked for something 
incorrect (like S waves in the core shadow). 
.LP
Any other message indicate a library routine.
