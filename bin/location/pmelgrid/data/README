This is a test suite for pmelgrid, but it also implicitly tests
db2pfstream and pfstream2db.  To run the test suite:

1.  Unpack the input data tar file with
tar xf testdata.tar

2.  Unpack the tar file that contains what the test suite
should produce.  That is 

tar xf testout.tar

This will yield a testout directory.  The testout directory 
contents can be compared to what you get by running the 
test in the directory called pmeltest.  i.e. after running
pmelgrid the contents of pmeltest and testout can be compared
file for file.

3.  Run the test by typing:

cd pmeltest
runtest.csh

4.  The test completes in about 1 minute on a SunBlade 100. pmelgrid
produces some output to stdout that can be compared to the run by looking at 
the file testout/runtest.log
