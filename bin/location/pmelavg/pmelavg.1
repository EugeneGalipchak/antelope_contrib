.SH NAME
pmelavg - average grid-based solutions produced by pmel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
pmelavg db [-pf pffile]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The implementations of pmel (dbpmel(1) found in Antelope 4.5 
and pmelgrid, which has not yet been released) found in
in this package focus on geographically defined gridding described
in cluster(1).  That is, they aim to satisfy the approximations of
multiple event location methodologies, of which pmel is an example,
by only utilizing groups of events located close together in space.
In this process, however, it is inevitable that many if not most 
events in a catalog get associated with more than one target point
in space.  As a result, the output of pmel often has multiple origin
estimates for the same event from overlapping constellations of
events associated with different grid points.  \fIpmelavg\fR 
averages these multiple estimates in a fairly simple way and defines
it's estimate as the prefor for that evid.
.LP
The algorithm used is a minor variant on a simple average.  Each 
event is compared to it's distance from the hypocentroid of the group 
with which it is associated.  Below a cutoff distances set in the parameter
file (see below) an event is given full weight.  If the distance of an event
from the hypocentroid of the group is larger than the cutoff a 1/r 
weight is applied (correctly normalized to have a unit weight at the 
cutoff distance.).  To make the algorithm a simple mean simply make the
cutoff distance a large number.  To make the average approximate a nearest
neighbor estimate, make r smaller than the nominal grid spacing.  
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
Use the -pf option to specify an alternative pf to the stock one 
defined by the program name (i.e. pmelavg.pf).
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.LP
\fIpmelavg\fR has one major parameter that controls it's behaviour.  
The real parameter \fIfull_weight_distance\fR sets the cutoff parameter
described above.  Units are assumed to be kilometers.
.LP
This program also uses dbprocess to form a working view.  The sequence
passed to dbprocess is defined by the input Tbl \fIpmelavg_dbview\fR.
This should not normally be altered.  It was made a parameter instead of
being hard wired into the program to make it less susceptible to schema
changes and changes in attribute naming conventions.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
Making the cutoff very small could cause problems in an obvious way 
with a divide by 1/r weighting scheme.  Anything rational for this 
parameter (e.g. larger than 0.1) should not cause a problem.
