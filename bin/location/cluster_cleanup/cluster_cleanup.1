.TH CLUSTER_CLEANUP 1 "%G%"
.SH NAME
cluster_cleanup - removes redundant cluster associations for pmelgrid
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
cluster_cleanup dbin dbout [-pf pffile]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program is part of a suite of programs connected to what is best
called pmelgrid.  This is a relocation method that uses 
multiple event location in combination with a (normally) three-dimensional
grid of control points.  Preliminary hypocenter locations are associated
to points in space with a companion program cluster (cluster.1).  
Experience has show that the current algorithm used in cluster frequently
builds completely or nearly completely redundant associations with 
neighboring grid points.  This program aims to remove redundant 
grid associations.
.LP
This program opens an extension table called "hypocentroid" in an 
input database.  It loads a grid file from the database controlled by
a parameter file definition.  The program checks the location of 
computed hypocentroids in the input database relative to each grid 
point.  If multiple grid points have hypocentroids that fall within 
the same grid cell the program chooses the one with the maximum number
of event associations and writes this to the output database.  
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The -pf parameter can be used to use an alternative to the standard pffile
derived from the program name -- the usual Antelope convention.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.LP
\fIgridname\fR is a string parameter used to identify the GCLgrid that 
contains the set of control points to be used by the program.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.nf
cluster(1), dbpmel(1), makegclgrid(1)
.fi
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
The program is not very general.  It will only work with GCLgrid objects
stored in a database.  The database design of the hypocentroid and
cluster tables do not require this.
