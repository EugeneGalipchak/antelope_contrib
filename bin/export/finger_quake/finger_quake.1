.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfinger_quake\fR creates and/or overwrites the users "$HOME/.plan" with a 
description of the bulletin to be reported and a listing of events.  It is intended to
be run on an operating real-time network.  Remote users can run a finger command
for "user@yourhost.xxx" to retrieve the real-time bulletin.  Note that the finger
command can be a security risk and is often disabled by sys-admins: check to see
that it is enabled for users outside of your local network.  Very often the "-l" 
option must be used.  See \fBfinger\fR(1).

A unique introduction to your bulletin can be written and applied through
a parameter file (see PARAMETER FILE section below).  Separate accounts must be 
used for each real-time network bulletin.  The standard user name is "quake".

The script will run indefinitely, checking the input \fIdatabase\fR for modifications
and updating the bulletin as needed.  The length of time between checks to the
update table can be adjusted on the command line.
 
The default output \fI~/.plan\fR will list events in the following format:

There are currently 5 events recorded by ANZA for the past 1 days.
Last update: 08/24/2000 (237) 06:52:10.000 PDT


.fi
.ft R
The most recent events are at the top of the list.  Any unreviewed events are marked
with a "*" after the magnitude type.  Local events can be given more specific locations 
than teleseismic events if you have a "place" table (see places1.2 schema).
If there is no place table, or at a distance greater than the dist_gregion value specified 
in the parameter file, the gregion command is used to determine a general location name for the event.

The \fBqedd\fR(1) program can be used to retrieve this bulletin.  

The \fBfinger_quake\fR script should be run as a background process.  The
output should be a stable product that the community can
depend on.  Format, number of events, or time period covered should not
require frequent changes.  Thus, you might want to make the \fBfinger_quake\fR 
program part of your running \fBrtexec\fR if you have an operating 
real-time system.  Alternatively, run \fBfinger_quake\fR from the command line.

See http://epicenter.ucsd.edu/ANZA/faq/rtcatalogs.html for suggestions on how to use these two programs under a running \fBrtexec\fR(1).


.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB-v\fR
Verbose messages. (Optional)

.IP \fB-V\fR
Very verbose messages. (Optional)

.IP \fB-o\fR
Exit the program after a single execution.  This is useful for times when you
receive a request for "finger quake" format data that has already scrolled
off your on-line listing. (Optional) 

.IP \fB-g\fR
Use the gnis1.0 schema place table rather than the places1.2 schema.  The default 
schema is places1.2.  Ideally you would convert the older format gnis1.0 place table
to the newer places1.2 format using \fBdbconvert\fR(1) prior to starting \fBfinger_quake\fR.  (Optional)

.IP \fB-p\fR \fIpf\fR
Choose the specified parameter file \fIpf\fR instead of the default, finger_quake.pf.
You will need to modify the default in order to personalize the information you are
presenting for your network.  (Optional)

.IP "\fB-d\fR \fIday\fR | \fB-e\fR \fIevents\fR"
Specify either the number of days of events you want reported, or the total number of
events you wish to be listed.  The program defaults to printing the most recent
20 events. If there are fewer events in the event table than the number you request
\fBfinger_quake\fR will report all of the events in the event table.  (Optional) 

.IP "\fB-a\fR \fIalternate_home_dir\fR"
Update an alternate user's $HOME/.plan file.  The user executing the program will
need to have read/write permissions in this alternate home directory. This is useful
if you wish to update the .plan file of user "quake", but you run the program as user "rt".
(Optional)

.IP "\fB-t\fR \fImagnitude_threshold\fR"
Only report magnitudes greater than the given value.  The default is to report
all events in the catalog that have positive magnitudes. If you want events with
null magnitudes reported use "-t -999.0". (Optional)

.IP "\fB-l\fR \fIplace_subset\fR"
Only use placetypes matching this criteria.  This is intended to be a very simple 
subset, such as "placetype=='ppl'".  Ideally, you would already have reduced your
place(s) table to the smallest possible subset before starting this program.  See 
EXAMPLE below. (Optional)

.IP "\fB-s\fR \fIorigin_subset\fR"
Report origins matching this subset criteria.  This is intended to be a very simple 
subset, such as a distance criteria, or author specification.  It can also be used 
to reject unreviewed origins.  See EXAMPLE below. (Optional)

.IP "\fB-y\fR \fI2\fR | \fI4\fR"
Use a 2 or 4 digit year in the report.  Currently \fBqedd\fR(1) only supports a 2 digit
year.  If this option is not specified, the default output is a 2 digit year. (Optional)

.IP "\fB-i\fR \fIupdate_interval\fR"
Time in seconds to wait between checks for an updated catalog.  The default of
300 seconds can be overridden with this option.  The bulletin will only be updated if
the checked catalog has been updated.  Otherwise no updates are made to the .plan file: this
includes no update to the "Last update" time reported in the bulletin. (Optional) 

.IP \fIdatabase\fR
Input database that is being updated in real-time.  Must have a css3.0 (or rt1.0) 
format origin and event table.  Prefor's must be set. (required)

.SH FILES
An ASCII file ".plan" is created in the users home directory.  The file is overwritten
if it already exists.  

A css3.0 origin and event table are needed in order to produce a bulletin.

A places1.2 place table with "ppl" locations is needed if the \fIuse_place_name\fR option is set
to yes in the parameter file.  These tables are produced from files downloaded from the GNIS 
website (http://mapping.usgs.gov) and converted with the \fBgnis2db(1)\fR script.

   Welcome to the UCSD-SIO-IGPP Real-time Seismic Array Processing Group
   Automated locations of the Anza Real-time Broadband Array (ANZA)

This is a list of automated locations for earthquakes recorded by the ANZA
network.  All seismic events processed/recorded by this network are included:
this includes local, regional, and teleseismic earthquakes as well as other
non-seismic events.  

Entries with a "*" have not been reviewed by a human.  These origins are
undergoing continuous review and thus can change, be removed, or deleted
at any time.  Note that location and magnitudes for EVENTS IN THIS LIST 
ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.  These are not final solutions.

All times are UTC (Greenwich Mean Time).  Subtract 8 hours to determine
Pacific Standard time, subtract 7 hours for Pacific Daylight time.  

Depths are in km.  Magnitudes can be Mb, Ms, or Ml.  The region associated 
with each teleseismic quake is the geographic region name as defined by 
Flinn, Engdahl and Hill (BSSA, 64, pp 771-992, 1974).  Distances for most 
earthquakes are given from the nearest populated place.
 
Instead of the typical quality factors (A, B, C, or D), we use the "Q" to 
report the author or the reported location. The codes used for this bulletin 
are as follows:  
          f,j,v,r = UCSD location 
                Q = USGS QED bulletin
                W = USGS PDE weekly bulletin
		C = SCSN bulletin

.fi
.LP
The first part of the parameter file requires default values to 
be set.

.IP "network"

Text string used for descriptive output in the bulletin.

.IP "place_name" 
The descriptor file for the ".place" table.  The .place table
is described in the places1.2 schema which is a contributed schema
written by Kent Lindquist.  The complete table can contain latitude and longitude 
coordinates for populated places, schools, mountain summits, 
airports, cemeteries, etc.  The user can choose to subset the place table
to select only populated places or places within a certain distance if the \fB-l\fR option
is chosen.  In order to speed up the script, you might want to create a place table that is already 
reduced to only ftypes/places of "ppl" and to subset the table to cover only your area of interest.  

A ".places" table from the gnis1.0 schema can also be used, but you must
use the \fB-g\fR option to indicate that the place_name is of this scehma.

The \fBgnis2db\fR(1) script can be used to convert quote-comma delimited 
files from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).  
See http://mapping.usgs.gov.

.IP "use_place_name" 
Whether or not you want the place_name database used for this finger bulletin.
Value should be "yes" or "no".

.IP "dist_gregion" 
The distance beyond which you wish only to report the gsregion name.  This
number is irrelevant if use_place_name is set to "no".   

.IP "mag_pref"
An ordered list of magnitudes to check for each reported origin.  The first 
magnitude from the list will be reported if found in the origin table for each
individual event: subsequent magnitudes will be ignored.  Currently css3.0
only reports mb, ms, or ml magnitudes in the origin table.

.IP "auth_pref" 
An associative array that lists the possible database author names for
origins determined by local analysts or the names of external catalog 
authors.  You can include some basic Perl regex pattern matching. 

.LP
The second part of the parameter file contains an introductory
text message that will be placed at the head of the bulletin.
This should be modified to include your specific local contact
information as well as any information about the authors
and external catalogs that may be used.  No variable expansion
is allowed and all embedded newlines, quotes and backslashes
will appear as they are in the parameter file.  See \fBpf(5)\fR 
for more information on the "Literal" value.

Please make sure that you modify this message.  Although I do not
mind answering questions about this program, I would rather not be
the contact for the bulletin you are publishing.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Standard Antelope environment is needed.  

The environment variable DBLOCKS may need to be set to "yes".

.SH EXAMPLE
.LP

The following example will run the \fBfinger_quake\fR program using the specific
parameter file for the Anza network, finger_quake_anza.pf.  The most
recent 50 events found in the origin table of db/anza will be reported.

.fi
.RE
.ft R
.LP
Note that some systems will require the "-l" flag for the 
full bulletin to be displayed.  (See \fBfinger(1)\fR).


This example assumes that you want the most recent 7 days from the
KNET catalog for all events with magnitudes greater than 1.0 and
events within 5.0 degrees of station AAK (42.6333N 74.9444W).
.ft CW
.RS .2i

This example subsets the place table for places that are "schools" and
reports all events over magnitude 5.0 for the past year.  The program will only run once.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"

Not fully tested.  Use caution...

You must have both an origin and event table with prefor set for 
each event.

I think I have it set up so that it won't die unpleasantly if you are
asking for more events than exist in the database.  However, I am quite
sure that there are many situations for which I have not tested. 

This program can be very slow if you have a large database of placenames.

The environment variable DBLOCKS may need to be set to "yes" if
you are updating your \fIdatabase\fR by the \fBreflect\fR/\fBreflectd\fR 
method.  \fBfinger_quake\fR will run without DBLOCKS set, but if the 
\fIdatbase\fR is updated by \fBreflect\fR while you are in the middle of 
getting origin information, you will see an error message similar to:
