.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmk_dmc_files\fP is designed to create and track the updates a network 
operator makes to a dataless SEED volume, virtual network definition (VND).  
When changes were made and what they were is important 
for dynamic networks such as the USArray Transportable Array.  
.LP
This script will generate either (1) a single station or combined network dataless 
SEED volume or (2) a virtual network defintion file.  It allows for a comment on 
why the update was made to be tracked in an extension table, \fIdmcfiles\fP.
The output table can then be querried to retrieve the comment for products
such as webpages.  Of course, the results will only be as good as the comments
that are entered.  The output \fIdmcfiles\fP extension table is also used by
the \fBims2dmc\fP program.

\fBmk_dataless_seed\fP is called to generate the dataless volume.  \fBdeployment2vnd\fP
is called to generate a Virtual Network Definition file.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Verbose output.  
.IP -z
Use gzip to compress the output dataless SEED volume.
.IP "-p parameter_file"
Parameter file to use.  The default parameter file name is \fBmk_dmc_files\fP.
.IP "-d output_dir"
Output directory for dataless SEED volume or vnd file.  This overrides the default
directory, \fIdataless_dir\fP or \fIvnd_dir\fP, in the parameter file.
.IP "-N net"
Network code to use in the output dataless SEED name.  This overrides the default
net code from the parameter file.  Irrelevant if -V option is selected.
.IP "-s sta"
Generate a dataless seed for this single station.  Irrelevant if -V option is selected.
.IP "-f filename"
Output dataless SEED or VND filename.  The default filename for a dataless SEED
volume will be: \fIDATALESS.XX.YYYY.MM.DD\fP or \fIDATALESS.XX_STA.YYYY.MM.DD\fP where
XX is replaced with the value of -n, the default_seed_network from site.pf, 
or is left as "XX" if these other two values are undefined.  The default filename
for a VND will be: \fIVNET_YYYYMMDD.csv\fP where VNET is replaced with the value given 
to -V.  If the -z option is used the output file name will have .gz appended to it.  See 
BUGS AND CAVEATS below if using -z with the -o option.
.IP "-o orb"
Output orb for \fBorbxfer2\fP(1).  See BUGS AND CAVEATS below.
.IP "-V vnet"
Generate a Virutal Network Definition (VND) file using the specified virtual network
code.  These codes are created and maintained by the DMC.  Example vnets include: _US-TA, 
_US-BB, _OBSIP, _ANSS, etc.  See http://www.iris.edu/vnets.  Either -V or -D must be specified
on the command line.
.IP -D
Generate a dataless SEED volume rather than a VND file. Either -V or -D must be specified
on the command line.
.IP dbin
Input database from which the dataless or VND is generated.  See \fBmk_dataless_seed\fP(1) or
\fBdeployment2vnd\fP(1) for requirements.  This argument is required.
.IP dbtrack
Database where the tracking table, \fIdmcfiles\fP exists.  This may be different 
than \fIdbin\fP.  This argument is required.	
.IP comment
A descriptive comment that describes what prompted you to make a new 
dataless SEED volume or changes to the VND.  The maximum string length is 180 characters.  The 
parameter file has a very generic default comment if you do not specify one
on the command line.  The maximum comment length is 180 characters.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Need to have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh and environment variable
$PFPATH set.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
Below is the default \fBmk_dmc_files\fP parameter file.
.in 2c

vnd_dir			vnd 
dataless_dir		dataless

.ps
.fi
.ft R
.in 
.LP

This is a very basic parameter file that specifies default output 
directories and a basic comment.

.IP \fIvnc_dir\fP
Output directory where VND files will be saved.
.IP \fIdataless_dir\fP
Output directory where dataless files will be saved.
.IP \fIdefault_comment\fP
The default comment to be placed in the \fIdatales\fP table.  The 
maximum length of this string is 180 characters.

.SH EXAMPLE
.LP Generate a dataless for station 109C and keep it in compressed 
format after a datalogger swap.  Do not transfer it via orbxfer2.
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf

%\fB mk_dmc_files -D -z -s 109C dbmaster/ta_only dbops/usarray "109C datalogger swap"
.fi
.ft R

.LP Generate a VND for the _US-TA virtual network after adding two new stations.  Transfer it via orbxfer2.
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf

%\fB mk_dmc_files -V _US-TA -o anfexport:meta dbmaster/anf dbops/anf "Added X21A Z22A"

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
Errors from the system calls to \fBmk_dataless_seed\fP or \fBdeployment2vnd\fP are 
not trapped properly by the elog routines.
.LP
Make sure your input database has no aggregious errors.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
This has not been extensively tested.
.LP
If there is no reader attached to the specified output orb with -o, the program 
will hang until a reader is attached.  To avoid this behavior, the wait_match 
parameter in the orbxfer2.pf file must be blank.
.LP
The 4.9 and earlier versions of orbxfer2 had a bug such that compressed files
pushed into the orb would retain there file names (i.e. myfile.gz), but would 
actually be uncompressed before placement in the orb.  The receiver would then
get "myfile.gz" out of the orb, but it would be an ucompressed file.  Until this
bug is resolved in the next Antelope release, do not use the -z and -o options
together.
.LP
See the current SEED manual for a full description of a dataless SEED volume.
.LP
Converse with the DMC regarding the format of the VND files.
