.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The availability of data through this wave_server depends on the settings 
for orb2db. Various parameters in orb2db can affect how quickly data 
are written from memory into the real-time database. For details, see orb2db(1).

The earthworm wave_serverV request protocol GETSCNRAW is not implemented, 
since the source database for db2ew_wave_server does not have data 

The wave_serverV protocol returns the sample rate even if data request
completely missed the tank contents. For the moment this is ignored--
I can't see why it's necessary and will defer the strangeness of coding 
to find the sample rate for data that is not there.
