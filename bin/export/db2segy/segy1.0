	Description ( "Shot information table" ) 
	Detail {
		Special table for dealing with controlled source explosion
		data with datascope.  Table is used to hold basic information
		about an individual shot.  Note that lat and lon
		serve as a reference absolute position for a local 
		coordinate system.  dnorth and deast are local coordinates
		relative to this refernce point.  This is used because
		of common practice in controlled source studies to use
		local coordinates relative to an origin.  The relation
		of elev and edepth is different.  elev is the elevation
		of the top of the ground surface for a shot point and
		edepth is the depth of emplacement of the shot.
