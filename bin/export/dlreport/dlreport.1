.SH NAME 
dlreport \- summarize dlevents in a mailable report 

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
dlreport [-d 'time'] [-n ndays] [-v] [-m email1,email2,...] [-s subset] {-S | -E} db
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdlreport\fP summarizes the dlevents that have been recorded in a dlevent
table (see \fBlogs2dlevent\fP(1)).  The summaries can be sorted either by
dlname (\fI-S\fP) or by dlevtype (\fI-E\fP).  

.SH OPTIONS

.IP "-d ndays_lag"
Normally, the report covers the previous UTC day.  This option allows specifying
a different start time.
.IP "-n ndays"
This is the total number of days of logs to review.  For instance, if you wish
to review the previous week of logs, not including the current (incomplete) day,
set -n to 7.  The default is 1 day.
.IP "-m email1,email2"
When specified, \fBdlreport\fP attempts to send the report to the email addresses 
specified here rather than to standard out.
.IP "-s"
A subset expression that must be valid for the dlevent table.
.IP "-v"
Verbose output.
.IP "db"
Output db that must use the dlevent schema extension to css3.0 and have a dlevent
table.

.SH FILES

You must have a valid dlevent table. See \fBorb2logs(1)\fP.

.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
The intent for this script was to run it as a nightly or weekly cronjob on a real-time 
system to help summarize various interactions with the datalogger 

.LP
A cronjob listing in rtexec.pf that runs on Thursday summarizing the previous 
week of dlevents based on a station (datalogger) sort might look like:
