.SH NAME
ims2dmc \- send IMS1.0 short bulletin files to DMC and track in database 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBims2dmc \fP[-v] [-V] [-m email1,email2,...] [-s \fIsubject\fP] \fIfile\fP \fIdatabase\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBims2dmc\fP uses \fBrtmail\fP to transfer IMS1.0 short bulletin files to
the DMC.  It also updates a \fIdmcbull\fP table that tracks when the file
was transferred to the DMC and some information about the content of those
files.

As of early 2008, the DMC requests that the files be sent to phasemail@iris.washington.edu
with the subject line of "PICKS".  This address should be included with any others
who might need to be informed of the file availability using the -m option.  Except for 
test purposes, there should be no reason to change the subject line.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Verbose log messages
.IP -V
Overwhelmingly verbose log messages.  Useful for debugging purposes only.
.IP "-m email1,email2,..."
Email addresses for those who will receive bulletin files.  The DMC requests
that phase picks be sent to phasemail@iris.washington.edu.
.IP "-s subject"
Subject for the email.  The DMC requests that the subject line be "PICKS".  
You should not have to change this.
.IP file 
Name of the file containing IMS1.0 short file format phase and origin information.
.IP database
Database which contains the dmcbull table to be update.
.SH FILES
The IMS1.0 short file format with DMC modifications is described in the
man page for \fBdb2ims\fP.  
.SH ENVIRONMENT

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
All bets are off if the file is not of the proper format.

The dmcbull table is reviewed by the db2ims program for duplicate filenames.

Sending of duplicate files is allowed.

No checks are made on the size of the file you are trying to send.  Note that
some mailservers may limit the size of an attachment and this program will likely
fail silently if that limit is exceeded.
