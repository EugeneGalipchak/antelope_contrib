.TH ims2dmc 1 
.SH NAME
ims2dmc \- send IMS1.0 short bulletin files to DMC and track in database 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBims2dmc \fP[-v] [-V] {-m email1,email2,... | -o \fIorb\fP} [-s \fIsubject\fP] \fIfile\fP \fIdatabase\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBims2dmc\fP uses \fBrtmail\fP or \fBorbxfer2\fP to transfer IMS1.0 short 
bulletin files to the DMC.  It also updates a \fIdmcbull\fP table 
that tracks when the file was transferred to the DMC and some information about 
the content of those files.  If transferring via orbxfer2, the \fIdmcfiles\fP table 
is also updated. 
.LP
As of early 2008, the DMC requests that the files be sent to phasemail@iris.washington.edu
with the subject line of "PICKS".  This address should be included with any others
who might need to be informed of the file availability using the -m option.  Except for 
test purposes, there should be no reason to change the subject line.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Verbose log messages
.IP -V
Overwhelmingly verbose log messages.  Useful for debugging purposes only.
.IP "-m email1,email2,..."
Email addresses for those who will receive bulletin files.  The DMC requests
that phase picks be sent to phasemail@iris.washington.edu.  Either the -m or 
the -o option must be selected.
.IP "-o orb"
Output/transmit orb for orbxfer2(1).  File will be transferred to this orb that
the DMC (or others) watch with orbxfer2 in receiver mode.  See BUGS and CAVEATS for
potential changes needed for orbxfer2.pf.  Either the -m or the -o option must be selected.
.IP "-s subject"
Subject for the email if -m option is used.  The DMC requests that the subject line be "PICKS".  
You should not have to change this.
.IP file 
Name of the file containing IMS1.0 short file format phase and origin information.
.IP database
Database which contains the dmcbull table (and optionally dmcfiles table).
.SH FILES
The IMS1.0 short file format with DMC modifications is described in the
man page for \fBdb2ims\fP.  
.SH ENVIRONMENT
\fBims2dmc\fP requires that the dmcbull and dmcfiles css3.0 schema extensions be installed.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
All bets are off if the file you attempt to transfer is not of the proper format.
.LP
The dmcbull table is reviewed by the db2ims(1) program for duplicate filenames.  Duplicates
are given a file name incremented by one. 
.LP
Sending of duplicate files is allowed.
.LP
No checks are made on the size of the file you are trying to send.  Note that
some mailservers may limit the size of an attachment and this program will likely
fail silently if that limit is exceeded.  If file size is going to be "too large"
use the orbxfer2 transfer mechanism (-o option).
.LP 
When using the default orbxfer2.pf file, if there is no reader attached to the 
specified output orb with -o, the program will hang until a reader is attached.  
To avoid this behavior, the wait_match parameter in the orbxfer2.pf file must be blank.
