.SH NAME
dbrecenteqs \- maintain a web site showing recent earthquakes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
dbrecenteqs [-h] [-i indexmap_pffile] [-g globalmap_pffile] dbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION

dbrecenteqs watches a real-time database of hypocenters, customizing
the stock maps and creating individual maps for each earthquake as they
occur.  dbrecenteqs creates the html code for a complete web-site of
recently detected earthquakes. If the keep_ndays parameter-file option
is specified, the database is cleaned up routinely upon each run. If
keep_ndays is not specified or is set to 0, no cleanup is performed.

If necessary, dbrecenteqs creates or adds to the mapstock table of
the database in dbrecenteqs1.0 or related schema.  For the default
behavior, a new stock index map is created based on the specifications
in the parameter file. An index map or global map may be added to the
mapstock table, with the -i or -g options (respectively), which read
from a parameter file in the style of dbevents(1). dbrecenteqs will 
exit after exercising these functions, since they are meant exclusively
as setup utilities.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-g globalmap_pffile Add specified global map to mapstock table"
.IP "-i indexmap_pffile Add specified index map to mapstock table"
.IP "-h don't regenerate focus maps; only recreate html"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
"Couldn't find alchemy. Use alternate image-conversion method or fix path."
This message indicates that the preferred image-conversion method, via the 
ImageAlchemyPS software package from HandMade Software Inc., is not installed
or not available on the path. A different conversion method, such as "pnm" or 
"imagick", should be specified in the parameter file's 
pixfile_conversion_method field.
