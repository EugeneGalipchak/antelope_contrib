.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdbampmag \fP[-p \fIpfname\fP] [{-use_if_not_associated|-use_if_not_defining}]
                [-make_magtables] [-use_mean] [-use_p2p] [-v] \fIdb\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdbampmag\fP is a program that computes magnitudes for a
specified origin in a database. Depending on your choice,
the mb,ml or ms field in the specified
origin row is filled in with the respective magnitude. This
program computes magnitudes in a manner similar to
\fBorbampmag(1)\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-p pfname"
Name of program parameter file. This argument is optional.
The actual parameter file name is \fIpfname\fP.pf.
The default value of \fIpfname\fP is \fBdbampmag\fP.
.IP "{-use_if_not_associated|-use_if_not_defining}"
If -use_if_not_associated is set, then all stations in the
\fBdbampmag\fP parameter file are used regardless if they were
detected and associated with each origin.
If -use_if_not_defining is set, then only stations in the
\fBdbampmag\fP parameter file that are detected and associated with
each origin are used, including stations that are associated
but are not "defining" in the location.
If neither option is set, then, by default, only stations
in the \fBdbampmag\fP parameter file that are detected, associated
and are "defining" in the location for each origin are used.
.IP "-make_magtables"
If this is set, then the netmag and stamag table rows are
created. Otherwise, by default, no netmag or stamag rows are
created.
.IP "-use_mean"
If this is set, then mean and standard deviation are used in the
network magnitude averages. Otherwise, by default, median and
quartile are used in the network magnitude averages.
.IP "-use_p2p"
If this is set, then the amplitude is computed as peak2peak/2,
wherever the minimum and maximum amplitude appear in the trace.
By default, the absolute maximum is used.
.IP "-v"
Verbose output flag.
.IP "db"
The input/output database name. If this is set to "-", then
a view is read from standard input and it is assumed that
the view is a subset view of the origin table.
This argument is required.
.IP "orid"
The origin id that identifies the event to process.
If this argument is not specified, then all origins in the
table or view are processed.
.SH "PARAMETER FILE"
The \fBdbampmag\fP parameter file must contain a table, named "mag",
that defines a list of all network_stations to be used
for processing magnitude values. An example \fBdbampmag\fP
parameter file is as follows:

# but to allow the usage of the same parameter file for both
# realtime (orbampmag) computations and postprocessing (\fBdbampmag\fP)
# they are included in the parameterfile

maxwaittime 60.0 # A hard timeout value in seconds for reading
                # waveform packets.  If no waveform packets
                # for the selected channels are received
                # within this time period, then the waveform
                # reading loop is interrupted and any further
                # processing for that event is aborted.

                # determine surface wave arrival time

                # R - rayleigh wave - here we use deg2km(delta) / v_r

time_window 0.5 # The waveform for processing the
                # magnitude is determined by a time window
                # starting from the arrival defined by the
                # time0 parameter to
                # time_factor*(S_time-P-time) seconds
                # after the first P-arrival.

.ne 17
mindelta    0   # distance range in degrees
maxdelta    180 #

# a 'general' magnitude formula could be:
#
#       c0+log10(amp)+c1*log10(delta)+c2*log10(delta*c3+c4)+c5
#
#       delta is the distance in degrees
#       where c2,c3,c4,c5 are station-dependent
#       thus c0 and c1 are to be changed here,
#       while c2,c3,c4,c5 are to be changed station-wise
#
# beware:  c0 has to be converted if you have a formula where delta is
# in km in this case subtract log10(deg2km(1))*c1 from the 'original'
# coefficient

The parameters are defined below.
.IP "c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5" 
define whatever you might find appropriate to compute your magnitudes.
.IP filter
Defines the filter applied to your data
.IP sta
The sta parameter identifies the station.
.IP chan_expr
This is a regular UNIX expression that is matched against the
actual data chan codes. If a match occurs, then the data channel is used.
.IP calib_from_db
If set to yes (or true or 1) then the \fIcalib\fP value for
converting counts to ground velocity (or displacement) is obtained
from the database calibration table. Otherwise, \fIcalib\fP is obtained directly
from the wfdisc row entries.
.IP decon_instr
If set to yes (or true or 1) then the instrument response
is deconvolved. Otherwise, the instrument response
is not deconvolved.
.IP apply_wa_filter
If set to yes (or true or 1) then the Wood-Anderson filter
is applied. Otherwise, the Wood-Anderson filter
is not applied.
.IP snr_thresh
This is a signal to noise threshold value. The noise for each
waveform preceding the initial P arrival is computed as a
root mean square. If the observed peak value (the signal)
of the event divided by the noise value is less than snr_thresh,
then the magnitude is not computed for the particular channel.
.LP
Applying instrument deconvolution can cause instabilites. For
broadband instruments, it is usually not necessary to apply
instrument deconvolution since the instrument response
is flat in the response band of the Wood-Anderson filter.
In cases where the instrument is a narrow band short period
at 1 Hertz, it is usually not necessary to apply either
the deconvolution or the Wood-Anderson filter. In all cases
the responses are converted to displacement and the correct
gains are applied to produce equivalent Wood-Anderson
drum recorder displacement.
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Instrument response deconvolution is not supported at this time.
Acceleration sensor channels are not supported at this time.
