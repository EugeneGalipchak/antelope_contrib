.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBatws_calc_mwp\fP is an interactive application that enables the calculation of Mwp.
The algorithm is based on the paper of Tsuboi et al. BSSA 1995 and the software
is from Barry Hirshorn of the Pacific Tsunami 
Warning System in Hawaii.
.LP
A database is required with at least the origin, wfdisc and assoc tables present.
Start the program with:
.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf

\fBatws_calc_mwp\fP your-database your-orid

.fi
.in
.ft R
.LP
This will bring up the interactive window. The labels at thetop of the window
describe the available actions. The user will move through the associated waveforms
and select the maximum moment as decribed in Tsuboi and then save the result which
is written to screen. Note that the resultant magnitude is not saved in the table.
