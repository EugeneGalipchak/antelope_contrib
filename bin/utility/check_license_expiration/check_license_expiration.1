check_license_expiration \- a program to check for expired and expiring Antelope licenses
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBcheck_license_expiration\fP [\fB\-d\fP \fIdays\fP] \fIfileglob\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcheck_license_expiration\fP is a program that will check to see if a
license parameter file or group of files has licenses keys that have 
expired or will expire soon. It is intended to be run on a centrally 
located collection of license files on a regular basis instead of having 
individual machines report the state of their licenses. Without the -d option, 
\fBcheck_license_expiration\fP defaults to a 30 day window to license keys that
it considers to be worth warning about. 

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-d days"
The number of days in the future to set the warning threshold for a license
key to be considered expiring soon.
