.SH NAME
editgclgrid - extract a portion of a GCLgrid based field object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
editgclgrid db [-pf pffile]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program edits a GCLgrid based field object.  
Edit in this context means extracting a portion and/or decimating
the input to produce a smaller output object.  The input 
field object is assumed to be stored in database db.  The output
field object is written to the same database with the file 
name and grid name changed.  These names are currently automatically
derived from the input grid name with a (somewhat verbose) appendage
of dec=x_y_z where x, y, and z are numbers that are decimation 
factors applied to x, y, and z respectively.  
.LP
The algorithm used here is very simple.  We carve out a block 
of points from the original grid starting with skip values (original
grid coordinates) decimating the grid by decimation fractors given 
for each coordinate direction.  The program will exit if any of 
the input parameters are not consistent with the dimensions of the
input grid.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The -pf parameter allows an alternate parameter file to the 
default editglcgrid.pf.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.LP 
\fIx1skip\fR.
Skip this many grid points of the input grid 1 coordinate to produce output. 
.LP 
\fIx2skip\fR.
Skip this many grid points of the input grid 2 coordinate to produce output. 
.LP 
\fIx1dec\fR.
Decimation factor for 1 coordinate.
.LP 
\fIx2dec\fR.
Decimation factor for 2 coordinate.
.LP 
\fIx3dec\fR.
Decimation factor for 3 coordinate.
.LP 
\fInx1out\fR.
Number of output points for 1 coordinate.
.LP 
\fInx2out\fR.
Number of output points for 2 coordinate.
.LP 
\fInx3out\fR.
Number of output points for 3 coordinate.
.LP 
\fIfieldtype\fR.
Specify field type of input field to be edited to produce output.
Must be one of the following:  GCLscalarfield,
GCLvectorfield, GCLscalarfield3d, or GCLvectorfield3d.
.LP 
\fIgridname\fR.
Name attached to parent grid. 
This name is perturbed as described above to produce a (hopefully)
unique name for the output grid.
.LP 
\fIfieldname\fR.
Name attached to parent field.  This will be duplicated for output.
.LP 
\fIgrid_directory\fR.
Directory to store data for output grid coordinates.
.LP 
\fIfield_directory\fR.
Directory to store data for output field.
.LP
\fIoutput_field_file_name\fR.
File name to use for output field.  Does not have to be unique as
output routine will append to this file if it already exists.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
The program will abort if requested decimation for the input
grid is not workable.  The diagnostics hopefully are informative
enough to explain what needs to be fixed to make the process work.
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
The algorithm used here is pretty crude.  The restriction to 
force the grids to mesh on decimation could be resolved if 
the grids interpolation methods were used instead of the crude
decimation used here.  
The frozen output grid naming convention is far from ideal
and will cause problems if one tries to output multiple grids
into a database with different skip factors but the same 
decimation constants.
