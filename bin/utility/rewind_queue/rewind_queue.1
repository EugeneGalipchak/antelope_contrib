rewind_queue - reset ProcessingQueue to retrieve orphans
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
rewind_queue queuefile

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is a necessary evil for programs using the 
ProcessingQueue object 
(http://geology.indiana.edu/pavlis/software/seispp/html/d9/ddd/classSEISPP_1_1DatascopeProcessingQueue.html)
to handle database driven processing.  This is used, for example,
in dbxcor when used in source array mode.  It does one simple
thing;  it resets the queue pointer to the first record in the database
view to which the queue file is linked. The ProcessingQueue uses a file
marking database rows as finished, skipped, being processed, or 
unfinished.  When a program crashes it will likely leave a record marked
as being actively processed, which causes a restart to skip that record
leaving data associated with that database record an orphan.  
This program solves this problem in a simple way by simply resetting
the queue pointer to the first row in the database view linked to the
queuefile.  
Users should recognize that the next run of a program
using that queue will have to handle the overhead of a linear search
through the queue to look for orphans.  The overhead, however, is 
tiny and the more important thing to recognize is the next run will
pick up the orphans.  
.SH FILES
The queue file this program hits is a frozen binary format linked
to the ProcessingQueue object AND a particular database view.  
It is a file of binary int number and it's contents are easily viewed
with the unix od with -t set to print host int values.  The first
three int values in the file are a header with the following attributes
in the following order:  total_record_count, datascope table number 
linked to this view, and the currrent high water mark.  This is 
followed by a vector of ints total_record_count long of processing
status values.  The program basically does nothing more than set
the current record counter to 0.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This program really should have a more elaborate edit mode that would
allow a subset condition to selectively mark queue entries for 
reprocessing.  Currently there is no way to reprocess a specific 
row in a view handled by a ProcessingQueue.   This can be a big
problem if working from a queue with days of work linked to it.
