.SH NAME
sac2db \- create css database from sac headers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBsac2db \fP[-v] \fIsacfile\fP [ \fIsacfile\fP ... ] \fIdatabase\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsac2db\fP creates a \fIdatabase\fP using (some of) the information
in a SAC header.  It creates the wfdisc, site and sitechan tables,
leaving the data in the original (float or intel float) format in the SAC file.
If event or arrival information is present, this information is
used to add to the event, origin, arrival and assoc tables.
.SH FILES
The input files must be SAC.
The output files are standard CSS format.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP \(bu 
Can't open sac file \fIfilename\fP
.IP \(bu 
Can't read sac file \fIfilename\fP
.br
For some reason, (perhaps permissions?), the named sac files
can't be read.
.IP \(bu 
station name (kstnm) undefined in \fIfilename\fP
.IP \(bu 
can't figure out channel name for \fIfilename\fP
.IP \(bu 
Sample rate (1/delta) undefined in \fIfilename\fP
.IP \(bu 
time not properly specified in \fIfilename\fP
.IP \(bu 
# data points (npts) undefined in \fIfilename\fP
.br
The specified data was not present in the header.
.IP \(bu 
SAC file \fIfilename\fP not incorporated.
.br
Because essential data (station name, channel name, time, sample rate,
or the number of data points) was not present in the sac header, the
named sac file was not incorporated into the \fIdatabase\fP.
.IP \(bu
nzyear has a value in the first century,
changing it to the current millennium.
.br
Sometimes, people fill in the year as 95 instead of 1995.  This
is detected and changed to 19xx (for 100 > year >= 70) and to 20xx
(for 70 > year > 0 ) 
.IP \(bu
station latitude is null in \fIfilename\fP
.IP \(bu
station longitude is null in \fIfilename\fP
.IP \(bu
station elevation is null in \fIfilename\fP
.br
The station location information was not completely filled out.
.IP \(bu
channel orientation not present in \fIfilename\fP
.br
The channel orientation (cmpaz and cmpinc) were not specified.
The program attempts to infer the orientation from the last
letter of the channel name.
.IP \(bu
Origin time not specified,
so using file start time for file \fIfilename\fP
.br
Oftentimes, the origin time O is not specified in the SAC header, although
a latitude and longitude are given.
.IP \(bu
couldn't add \fIfilename\fP to wfdisc
.IP \(bu
couldn't add sta='\fIsta\fP' ondate=\fIyearday\fP lat=\fIstla\fP lon=\fIstlo\fP elev=\fIstel\fP from \fIfilename\fP to site
.IP \(bu
couldn't add sta='\fIsta\fP' chan='\fIchan\fP' ondate=\fIyearday\fP hang=\fIhang\fP vang=\fIvang\fP edepth=\fIstdp\fP from \fIfilename\fP to sitechan
.IP \(bu
couldn't add time=\fIevtime\fP lat=\fIlat\fP lon=\fIlon\fP depth=\fIdepth\fP from \fIfilename\fP to origin
.IP \(bu
couldn't add a new event for file \fIfilename\fP
.IP \(bu
couldn't add sta='\fIsta\fP' time=\fItime\fP iphase='\fIiphase\fP' from \fIfilename\fP to arrival
.IP \(bu
couldn't add arid=\fIarid\fP orid=\fIorid\fP \fIfilename\fP to assoc
.LP
All these error messages indicate a problem in writing records to
the \fIdatabase\fP.
The message should indicate the root cause of the
problem (permissions or conflicting records in the \fIdatabase\fP).

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Because the sac header is not very complete, the \fIdatabase\fP records are
likewise missing important information.
Furthermore, because sac headers are often constructed by hand, they
tend not to be very consistent, and there are sometimes local conventions
which differ from place to place.
.LP
Generally, \fBsac2db\fP soldiers on with fairly verbose error messages.
Although it may fail at adding some site or sitechan records, these problems
can generally be fixed by editing the resultant \fIdatabase\fP by hand with
dbverify(1) (to find problems) and dbe(1) or dbset(1) to fix them.
.LP
A common complaint is that depths appear not to be copied correctly.
Apparently, it is common practice among SAC users to specify depth in
kilometers in the sac header; the documentation, however, clearly states
that all depths are in meters.  In the CSS schema, depths are in kilometers,
and consequently, \fBsac2db\fP divides depths from the sac headers by 1000.0 to
convert from meters to kilometers.
