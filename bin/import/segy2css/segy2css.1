.SH NAME
segy2css \- convert data in PASSCAL SEGY format to CSS format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBsegy2css [-event] [-ftbl] "fname"\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program reads seismic data in PASSCAL SEGY format and converts them to CSS format version 3.0.
.PP
The program reads PASSCAL SEGY data, the filename for which should be specified on the command line.
The filename should be specified in quotes (""). This allows the user to use wildcards
in filenames and handle entire groups of files at once, refer to long
names with abbrevations, and use part of names when we are uncertain about
complete versions. For example, if all data under directory \fB/test/data\fP
should be converted to CSS  format, the command line should be:
.RS
.IP 
\fBsegy2css "/test/data/*"\fP
.RE
.PP
The parameter \fB-event\fP can be optionally specified on the command line.
If this parameter is specified on the command line then the program
makes one \fIwfdisc\fR file for all data from one directory, even if those data
have a different \fIstart time\fR. If that parameter is not specified in the 
command 
line (i.e. by default), the program will make as many \fIwfdisc\fR files as there are 
different start times.
.PP
Each PASSCAL SEGY file has a 240 byte header, which contains information about the data. The information includes:
\fIchannel number, number of samples, sample rate, instrument serial number,
event start time\fR and more. The program builds a \fIwfdisc\fR file using these parameters. 
.PP
The program makes data and \fIwfdisc\fR files in the current directory.
The name of the data file will be in the form \fBYYDDDHHMMSS.w\fP and the name of the \fIwfdisc\fR file will be in the form \fBYYDDDHHMMSS.wfdisc\fP.
.PP
A conventional name for the specific instrument code can be specified in the
ascii file.
The full name of that file should be specified with the argument \fB-ftbl\fP in a command line (where \fBtbl\fP is full file name). A conventional name also can be specified  in the ".segy2css" file,
which should be in the HOME directory. In this case the program automatically looks for 
that file and reads it, so it's not necessary to specify \fB-ftbl\fP option.  The format of the \fBtbl\fP and ".segy2css" files are:
.RS
.IP 
INSNUM  STIME  ETIME  STANAME 
.RE
.PP
where INSNUM is the instrument serial number, STIME and ETIME are start and end 
time when the instrument was operational; and STANAME is the station code for the instrument serial number. The time format is \fBYYYYDDD:HH:MM:SS.s\fP. 
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
To convert all PASSCAL SEGY data whose names start with '92.345' from the directory
/data/segy:
.RS
.IP
\fBsegy2css "/data/segy/92.345*"\fP
.RE
.PP
To convert all PASSCAL SEGY data from the directory 'segy' and put all information in one wfdisc file:
.RS
.IP
\fBsegy2css -event "segy/*"\fP
.RE
.PP
.PP
\fBNOTE:\fP If on the command line you are specifying the whole directory as \fBfname\fP, then
that directory should contains only PASSCAL SEGY data and nothing else.
