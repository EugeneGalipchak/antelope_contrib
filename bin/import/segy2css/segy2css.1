.SH NAME
segy2css \- convert data in PASSCAL SEGY format to CSS format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBsegy2css [-event] [-ftbl] "fname"\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Program reads seismic data in PASSCAL SEGY format and converts them to CSS format version 3.0.
.PP
Program reads PASSCAL SEGY data, name of which should be specified in a command line.
Filename should be specified in quotes (""). This allows the user to use wildcard
in filenames and handle entire groups of files at once, refer to long
names with abbrevations, and use part of names when we are uncertain about
complete versions. For example, if all data under directory \fB/test/data\fP
should be convert to CSS  format, the command line should be:
.RS
.IP 
\fBsegy2css "/test/data/*"\fP
.RE
.PP
Parameter \fB-event\fP can be optionally specified in the command line.
If this parameter is specified in the command line then the program
makes one \fIwfdisc\fR file for all data from one directory, even if those data
have a different \fIstart time\fR. If that parameter is not specified in the 
command 
line (i.e. by default), program will make as many \fIwfdisc\fR files as there are 
different start times.
.PP
Each PASSCAL SEGY file has a 240 byte header, which contains information about the data. The information includes:
\fIchannel number, number of samples, sample rate, instrument serial number,
event start time\fR and more. The program builds \fIwfdisc\fR file using these parameters. 
.PP
The program makes data and \fIwfdisc\fR files in current directory.
Name of the data file will be in form \fBYYDDDHHMMSS.w\fP and name of \fIwfdisc\fR file will be in form \fBYYDDDHHMMSS.wfdisc\fP.
.PP
A conventional name for the specific instrument code can be specified in the
ascii file.
The full name of that file should be specified with the argument \fB-ftbl\fP in a command line (where \fBtbl\fP is full file name). A conventional name also can be specified  in the ".segy2css" file,
which should be in the HOME directory. In this case program automatically looks for 
that file and reads it, so it's not necassary to specify \fB-ftbl\fP option.  The format of the \fBtbl\fP and ".segy2css" files are:
.RS
.IP 
INSNUM  STIME  ETIME  STANAME 
.RE
.PP
where INSNUM is the instrument serial number, STIME and ETIME are start and end 
time when instrument was operational; and STANAME is station code for instrument serial number. The time format is \fBYYYYDDD:HH:MM:SS.s\fP. 
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
To convert all PASSCAL SEGY data whose name starts with '92.345' from directory
/data/segy:
.RS
.IP
\fBsegy2css "/data/segy/92.345*"\fP
.RE
.PP
To convert all PASSCAL SEGY data from directory 'segy' and put all information in one
wfdisc file:
.RS
.IP
\fBsegy2css -event "segy/*"\fP
.RE
.PP
.PP
\fBNOTE:\fP If in the command line you are specifying the whole directory as \fBfname\fP, then
that directory should contains only PASSCAL SEGY data and nothing else.
