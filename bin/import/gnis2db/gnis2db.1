.TH GNIS2DB 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
gnis2db \- convert GNIS feature-name files to database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
gnis2db gnis_file database [State]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
gnis2db takes a file of geographic names in GNIS (Geographic 
Name Information System) format, and converts it to a database 
in the places1.2 or related schema. 

Two common formats are supported. If no State is specified on the 
command line, the input lines will be parsed as though the first 
element is the state in which the feature occurs. If a State (e.g. 
"CA" or "AK") is specified on the command line, this is used in all 
rows added to the database, and the input lines are parsed assuming 
that they do not contain the state as the first field. [N.B. if state 
is not the first field of the input lines, but no single state is 
appropriate for the entire file, the state may be specified on the 
command line as the null value "-"].
