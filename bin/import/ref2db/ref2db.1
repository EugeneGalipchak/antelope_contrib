.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBref2db\fP reads data in REFTEK format, converts it to css3.0 and copies data
to a continuous database \fIdbname\fR. \fBref2db\fP can read REFTEK tapes,
REFTEK raw disks and REFTEK files, which where created with \fBrefdump\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-d datatype"
The output datatype may be specified to be "s4". The default
is "sd" - data in mini-seed format.
.IP "-e"
Tells \fBref2db\fP create data files and wfdisc records based on RefTek 
event start and end time. Each data file will contain data for one RefTek
event.
.IP "-l"
Will create logfile representing  data  in  Reftek instrument format.
It contains the instrument set-up information, the state-of-health 
information, and records on all events and their start&end&trigger times.
The logfile name will be in a form of \fIDASID_log\fR. 
.IP "-m srcname"
Only packets which belongs to DAS with serial number \fIdasmatch\fR
will be converted to css3.0.  
.IP "-p pfile"
A parameter file can be specified for \fBref2db\fP which contains a 
"DAS_serial_number to station_name" conversion table. By default
\fBref2db\fP looks for a parameter file with a name \fIref2db.pf\fR.
If \fBref2db\fP  can't find a parameter file then it makes 
station names as DAS serial numbers.    
.IP "-s size"
Specifies size of files which contain waveforms. Size should be specified
in seconds.
.IP "-n net"
If data will be converted to mini-seed format then a network code must 
be specified. \fIPS\fR is the default network code. 
.IP "-v"
Will print to stderr srcname and time of every packet read.
.IP "-w"
Will not write data to database. This option is usefull when user
wants only to get RefTek logfile or get information on data time gaps.
.IP "start_time end_time"
Specifies a time range of the RefTek data to be processed.
 
.SH TIMING ISSUE
.LP
Real life shows that RefTek data has many problems related to time. Time
jumps can be discovered in Data ( DT ) packets within one event as
well as between Event ( EH&ET ) packets in a continuous data flow. 
The following rule is used to calculate \fItime\fR in ref2db:
.IP
1. Time of a first data sample ( FDST ) of the event is equal to \fIFirst sample Time\fR
value from an Event Header ( EH ) packet.
.IP
2. Time of each next DT packet is calculated as:
.nf
		
		DT_extected_time = FDST + NSAMP*SAMPRATE
.fi
.IP
Where NSAMP is total number of samples of a current event 
were 
read before that packet and SAMPRATE is a sample rate in a current 
experiment. \fIDT_extected_time\fR will be used as a \fIreal time\fR 
for that packet.  \fIDT_extected_time\fR is compared to a time value 
of a DT packet to see that they are consistent. An information about 
time jumps between data packets  and RefTek events are placed to \fBTimErr.log\fP
file.  
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.LP
\fBref2db\fP uses a parameter file to convert DAS_serial_number 
to station name. 
If an environment variable PFPATH  is  specified,  \fBref2db\fP
searches   along   this   path for the parameter file;  otherwise  it  
searches  in $DSAP/data/pf and then the  current  directory.
The parameter file should be in form:
.nf

.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
1. Convert REFTEK data from 7838.raw file to mini-seed volumes with a network code
"XY"; store data in "saudi" database; show srcname and time of each packet. 
.nf

    ref2db -v -n "XY" 7838.raw saudi 

.fi
.LP
2. Convert data on a REFTEK tape which is in /dev/rst5 device 
to mini-seed volumes with a network code "XY"; store data in "saudi" database. 
.nf

    ref2db -n "XY" /dev/rst5 saudi 

.fi
.LP
3. Do not create database. Make RefTek logfile and get information about timing
problems. 
.nf

    ref2db -w -l  /dev/rst5 tmp
