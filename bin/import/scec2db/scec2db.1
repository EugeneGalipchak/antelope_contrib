.SH DESCRIPTION
When processing real-time data it is helpful to have external catalogs
against which you can associate your locations (using \fBdbassoc_rt\fR(1)).  One
source of this external catalog for southern California is SCEC, the 
Southern California Earthquake Center which runs the TriNet network.  They
produce a reviewed bulletin which is available via a web search.  This 
script attempts to automate the retrieval of their bulletin and the update
of your local catalog.  It can also be used to convert a preexisting file
from one of the supported formats to a css3.0 origin table.

.SS Formats
SCEC distributes their catalog in seven different formats: catread, scec_dc
CNSS, Simpson Map, Hypoinverse2000, Hypo71, and Hypoinverse phase.  Currently, 
\fBscec2db\fP only supports the hypo71, hypo2000, catread and scec_dc formats.  

.IP catread

A basic bulletin output.  Note that the magnitude field size is limited
and there is no explanation of event type (etype will be blank in origin
table).  Magnitude is assumed to be ml. 

Example of catread format listing:

.IP scecdc

More information than catread.  Magnitudes may be of different type, etype
is specified.  Information about number of data files is ignored.

.IP Hypo71

Hypo71 is more readable than, but is a subset of, the Hypoinverse format.
Multiple magnitude types are supported, etype is specified, many comments
could be translated.  This is the format I tend to use for retrieval.

.IP "Hypoinverse phase format"

With this format you could create arrival/assoc tables.  NOT SUPPORTED YET.


.SH OPTIONS

.IP -v 
Make some noise about what's going on. 

.IP -V 
Divulge more than is necessary about what's going on. 

.IP -d
Retrieve one day from bulletin.  
Without \fB-s\fP or \fB-e\fP specified, time window is assumed to
be 24 hours prior to "now".  When \fB-s\fP is specified with \fB-d\fP,
24 hours of data will be extracted after chosen \fIstart_time\fP. 
Supplying an  \fIend_time\fP in conjunction with \fB-d\fP works similarly.

.IP -w
Retrieve one week from bulletin.  
Without \fB-s\fP or \fB-e\fP specified, time window is assumed to
be 7 days prior to "now".  When \fB-s\fP is specified with \fB-w\fP,
7 days of data will be extracted after chosen \fIstart_time\fP.  
Supplying an \fIend_time\fP in conjunction with \fB-w\fP works similarly.

.IP -m
Retrieve one month (31 days) from bulletin.  
Without \fB-s\fP or \fB-e\fP specified, time window is assumed to
be 31 days prior to "now".  When \fB-s\fP is specified with \fB-m\fP,
31 days of data will be extracted after chosen \fIstart_time\fP.  
Supplying \fIend_time\fP in conjunction with \fB-m\fP works similarly.

.IP "-s \fIstart_time\fR"
Retrieve events from bulletin with times greater than this value.  Format must 
comply with conventions for \fBepoch\fR(3).   You must specify \fB-m\fP, \fB-w\fP, 
\fB-d\fP or \fB-s\fP \fIstart_time\fP.  If \fB-s\fP \fIstart_time\fP is chosen
without \fB-m\fP, \fB-w\fP, or \fB-d\fP and no \fB-e\fP \fIend_time\fP is 
selected, the current time will be chosen as the last possible event time to retrieve.  

.IP "-e \fIend_time\fR"
Retrieve events from bulletin with times less than this value.  Format must 
comply with conventions for \fBepoch\fR(3).  

.IP "-f \fIfilename\fR"
File containing SCEC format bulletin.  Use this when you have a preexisting
file to convert and do not want to use the web interface to retrieve a new
catalog.   

.IP "-c \fIformat\fR"
Required.  Specify the format of the input file name (if using \fB-f\fP) or
choose one of the supported formats. 

.IP "db_to_update"
Required.  Name of database you will create or update.  Preexisting origin
tables that have origins for the requested time period will be updated with
new lat/lon/time/ml values if there have been changes.  Any new origins will
be added.

.SH FILES
A temporary file called tmp_\fIformat\fP is created.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

Must have the standard Antelope environment variables.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
No parameter file needed.

.IP \(bu
The intent of this script was to have it run on a daily basis and update
a local catalog with any origins that were added or changed in the remote catalog.
This is easy to do when you have a running real-time system.  Edit the
cron listing in the rtexec.pf file (See \fBrtexec\fR(1)).  As I do not want to 
overwhelm SCEC's site with requests, I check for updates for the last week 
once each day and for the last month once each week (on the 5th day == Friday).  

From rtexec.pf file:

.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf
crontab &Arr{
scec2db    UTC 00 03 * * * scec2db -w -c catread catalogs/cit
scec2db    UTC 00 06 * * 5 scec2db -m -c catread catalogs/cit
}

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
When no \fB-m\fP, \fB-w\fP, or \fB-d\fP are chosen, \fB-s\fP must be used.  
If no \fB-e\fP \fIend_time\fP is selected, the current date is used as the
last event time.  If this time period is greater than 60 days, the program 
will fail.

.LP
The \fB-m\fP, \fB-w\fP, and \fB-d\fP options can be overridden by the use
of \fB-s\fP and \fB-e\fP.


.LP
If your request is too large for the scec website to handle (or if too many
people are requesting data when you are), you will receive a message
like this:

.ft CW
.RS .2i
.nf
perl: str2epoch: can't interpret '/'
        ** repeated 2 times
perl: str2epoch: can't interpret '<'
perl: str2epoch: no timezone 'PRE'
perl: str2epoch: can't interpret ':'
        ** repeated 2 times
.fi
.RE
.ft R

This means that the file transfer was not completed. Thus you have an
incomplete file to translate to css3.0.  Try making your search cover 
a shorter time range or try your search at a later time when there is
less network traffic.
