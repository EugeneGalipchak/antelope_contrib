.TH MAIL_PARSER_WRAPPER 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
mail_parser_wrapper\- script run by sendmail to launch mail_parser
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
mail_parser_wrapper
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This script is used to set the environment properly so that mail_parser(1)
will run, when mail_parser(1) is used to handle an automatic email account.
It may be necessary to edit this script slightly to account for local
differences in sendmail(1) setup. 

Installing mail_parser(1) to handle mail for a given email account may 
be as simple as opening a .forward file in the home-directory of the 
account, containing the path to the mail_parser(1) command: for example

.nf
nordic% cat /home/aeicauto/.forward
kent@giseis.alaska.edu, "|/home/aeicauto/mail_parser_wrapper || exit 75"
.fi

Note that this assumes a copy of mail_parser_wrapper has been placed in the
relevant home directory. Making a local copy is useful if any edits 
are necessary, for example to environment variables. Usually it is
necessary to remove group and world write permission from the
mail_parser_wrapper executable and from the .forward file. 

In practice, setting up automatic mail handling may require other
cooperation from your system administrator depending on which
sendmail(1) security features are activated.
