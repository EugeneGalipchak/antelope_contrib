.SH NAME
reb2db \- reformat Reviewed Event Bulletins to CSS3.0 database format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
reb2db filename \[filename ...\] dbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
reb2db converts Reviewed Event Bulletin files from the International
Data Centre of the Center for Monitoring Research (www.cdidc.org)
into css database format. Acceptable input formats include GSE2.0 and 
IMS1.0. Raw mail files with REB information may be fed to reb2db.

The algorithm field of the origin table abbreviates the analysis 
type ("auto"=automatic, "man"=manual, "guess") and the location 
method ("inversion", "patnrec"=pattern recognition, "grndtruth"=ground truth,
"other").

Not in IMS1.0 or GSE2.0 format

No DATA_TYPE line--assume IMS1.0 format
(reb2db expects to find either 
DATA_TYPE BULLETIN GSE2.0
or
DATA_TYPE BULLETIN IMS1.0
in the file)

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
If no DATA_TYPE line is found, reb2db assumes IMS1.0 format at the 
first instance that it hits an EVENT line. reb2db is a state-machine
that reads input lines successively from all supplied input files. If a 
file after the first file does not have an explicitly specified DATA_TYPE, 
the format (IMS1.0 or GSE2.0) will carry over from the previous file. 

Handling of the "IMS1.0 SHORT" format is untested and therefore unknown. 

The seaz field of the assoc table is not filled in since it does not appear
in the IMS1.0 format and since there is no guarantee of the presence 
of a site table. In principle seaz could be derived from the event location 
plus delta and esaz fields, but this has not been done. 

The specification of a pick as automatic shows up by appending the string 
":auto" to the author name of the arrival.
