.TH XPHASE2DB 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
Xphase2db - Save Xphase pickfile to an arrival table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
Xphase2db db [-phase name]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Special purpose program to take pickfiles created by the Xphase
picking program and store the resulting information in a css3.0
arrival table.  
The pickfile can only contain picks for a single phase type.  By
default this is P.  If other phases are picked, the -phase 
argument is used to set the phase name in the arrival table. 
.LP
The program reads the pickfile from standard input, so 
this program needs to be used either in a pipeline or
with input redirection.  
.LP
One field in the Xphase pickfile is the filename of the 
parent waveform file.  A parameter file is used to define
how this file name is parsed to extract the station and 
channel codes.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-phase"
Use following argument as the phase name instead of default phase name of P.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.LP
These parameters define how a file name in the pickfile should
be parsed to extract a proper station and channel code to use
for the sta and chan fields of the arrival table.  The parameters
involved are as follows:
.LP
\fBseparators\fR sets the separators used to divide the tokens
used to parse the file name in the pick file.  This string of 
characters is directly passed to the C function strtok(3).  
.LP
\fBstation_token_number\fR sets the number (the first token is
numbered 1 here, not 0 ala C) position of the token that defines
the station code in the file name.
.LP
\fBchan_token_number\fR is the same as station_token_number, but
for the channel code.
.LP
An example should clarify this.  Suppose we had the following
file name pattern:
.nf
1997273063118.00.ANA.BHZ
.fi
The separator here is the period character and the station
name, ANA, is the third token while the channel code, BHZ,
is the fourth token.  This file name would be correctly 
parsed with the following paramters:
.nf
separators .
station_token_number 3
chan_token_number 4
.ft CW
.RS .2i
.RE
.ft R
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.nf
strtok(3)
.fi
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
The strtok approach will not work on every obtuse naming
convention I've ever seen, but it should work most of the time.
Remember you can use multiple separators to parse something
strange like 1999244:13_22_33.2_ANA:BHZ.  (In this case it
would be :_. as the set of separators.
