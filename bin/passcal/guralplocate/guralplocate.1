.SH NAME
guralplocate - estimates station location from guralp digitizer log file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
guralplocate log1 log2 ... 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIguralplocate\fR program parses a series of log files
from a Guralp data logger written to a series of output files
by the SCREAM program or from a data dump from a SAM unit.  
From these files it extracts
lines in the log file containing latitude and longitude information.
It reads all these numbers into memory and computes the following
statistical estimates of the distribution of numbers:
mean, median, lower quartile, upper quartile, lower bound, 
upper bound, and the number of samples in the ensemble.  
The statistics are sent to standard output with labels 
defining the results for the latitude and longitude.
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
The method used to find the GPS fix data is crude and depends upon
a fixed format line written intot he log file.  If Guralp changes
the format of the GPS fix lines in this log file it will not work.
The algorithm is crude like old FORTRAN fixed format reads.
