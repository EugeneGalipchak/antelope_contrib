.SH NAME
q330gpslocate - estimates station location from Q330 log file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
q330gpslocate log1 log2 ... 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIq330gpslocate\fR program parses a series of log files
from a Quanterra Q330 data logger.  From these files it extracts
lines in the log file containing latitude and longitude information.
It reads all these numbers into memory and computes the following
statistical estimates of the distribution of numbers:
mean, median, lower quartile, upper quartile, lower bound, 
upper bound, and the number of samples in the ensemble.  
The statistics are sent to standard output with labels 
defining the results for the latitude, longitude, and elevation.
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
The method used to find the GPS fix data is crude and depends upon
a simple keyword search for Latitude and Longitude.  If Quanterra
changes the format of that line, this program will fail.
