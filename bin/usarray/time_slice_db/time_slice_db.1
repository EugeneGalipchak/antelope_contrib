.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtime_slice_db\fP is designed build complete periodic databases from a larger database.
The default time slice is by months, but options can split by year or day.
\fBtime_slice_db\fP will keep all data from the current month ( or year or day), and the 
previous number of \fIlag_periods\fP in \fIdbin\fP.  
Older data will be split from \fIdbin\fP into monthly ( or yearly or daily) databases.
\fBtime_slice_db\fP will reorganize the seismic database tables into the appropriate database 
directory structure - 
.IP \fIdirectory_base/YYYY_MM/dbbase_name_YYYY_MM\fP.  
.IP \fIdirectory_base/YYYY/dbbase_name_YYYY\fP.  
.IP \fIdirectory_base/YYYY_DDD/dbbase_name_YYYY_DDD\fP.  

.in
The decision for which db to include data is decided by the origin.time of the preferred origin for an event.  Even if other 
origins for the same event or associated arrivals cross over a time boundary, it is the preferred 
origin.time which controls the choice of db.

This program was written to address specific issues at the ANF for the USArray TA.  
It is designed to split up events including the following tables: 
event origin assoc arrival origerr stamag netmag emodel predarr.  It will also split up
the wfdisc, with the addition of the next day following the end of the output db so that 
events which have origin times at the end of the period can still be reviewed with the 
appropriate waveforms.  \fBtime_slice_db\fP will not move the actual waveforms 
(unless the \fI-f\fP option is used), it only
puts the correct references to where \fIdbin\fP waveforms are located.  If this program 
does not meet your needs, you should use  \fBdbsplit\fP.

This program is NOT designed to work on a live real-time database.  If you want to use on
a real-time system, first shutdown the appropriate rtexec, then use this program, finally
restarting rtexec.

.IP \fIdbin\fP 
database which needs to be sliced.
.IP \fIdbbase_name\fP 
database base name to build output db names.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
verbose
.IP -V
Extremely verbose.  Used for debugging purposes only.
.IP -C
Clean up input database.  Removing rows which have been moved to the output databases. 
Before starting copy the input database into the \fIlast_saved_db\fP directory using 
\fIdbcp -s dbin last_saved_db\fP.
.IP -Y
split database into years.  Files stored as \fIdaily_dbs/YYYY/dbbase_name_YYYY\fP.
.IP -D
split database into days.  Files stored as \fIyearly_dbs/YYYY_DDD/dbbase_name_YYYY_DDD\fP.
.IP -s
Don't  attempt  to  keep  external file references correct; just copy the tables, 
and don't update dir/dfile fields. See dbcp (1).
.IP -f 
Actually copies waveforms instead of referencing original waveforms. See dbcp (1).
.IP -b
Only slices big tables listed in pf file.
.IP -e
Only slices events.
.IP -w
Only slices waveforms.
.IP "-I idserver"
Name of idserver to be written into descriptor file for output database to use.
The default parameter idserver is none.
.IP "-P dbpath"
dbpath to be written into descriptor file for output database to use.
The default parameter dbpath is none.
.IP "-d directory_base"
directory base name for building the monthly databases
The default is ./monthly_dbs
.IP "-l lag_period"
Number of complete periods before present to allow to be processed.
The default is 1 in arrears, only skipping the current and immediately previous periods.
.IP "-p parameter_file"
Name of parameter file to use.  $PFPATH is searched to find parameter file.
The default parameter file name is \fBtime_slice_db\fP.
.IP "-t start_time"
Start time for processing data.
The default start time is \fB1 January 1970\fP.
.IP "-e end_time"
End time for processing data.
The default end time is \fBnow()\fP.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Need environment variable $PFPATH to be set.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
\fBtime_slice_db\fP parameter file elements are:

.IP big_tables 
typically very large tables which are not associated with waveforms or events.  
These tables listed need to have time, sta, chan included as fields.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This program does most the work using perl system calls to the Datascope interface.
This was done because of the memory usage in large databases which could not be really
freed in perl.  Using system calls keeps the memory usage at a managable level even for
megarow databases.
