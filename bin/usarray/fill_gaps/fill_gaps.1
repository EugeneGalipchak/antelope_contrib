.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfill_gaps\fP is designed to build the best possible waveform database, 
combining data collected from a real-time system with data retrieved from
on-site storage devices.  \fBfill_gaps\fP assumes there are valid wfdisc,
calibration, and gap tables from the rt system.  It also requires a clean wfdisc of 
baler data with no waveform overlaps made by \fBbuild_baler_data\fP.

\fBfill_gaps\fP creates a directory named \fIfilled_gaps\fP  where temporary 
databases are made with proper links to the waveforms.  The final step is to 
execute a series of \fBtrexcerpt\fP commands for each jdate from the gap table
between \fIstart_time\fP and \fIend_time\fP.

If the optional [\fIdmc_gap_db\fP] database is specified, then these gaps are also
filled in the output database.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
verbose
.IP -V
Extremely verbose.  Used for debugging purposes only.
.IP -T
Test mode.  Does not execute trexcerpt commands.
.IP "-n net      "
Select network.  Default is TA.
.IP "-r reject_stas"
Regular expression for stations to be rejected.  Default is "SUTB|V04C".
.IP "-s sta_match"
Regular expression for stations to be matched.  Default is ".*".
.IP "-b clean_baler_db"
Name of database containing clean baler data.  Default is "dbin_dir/baler/clean_data".
.IP "-o dbout"
Name of database containing clean baler data.  Default is "dbin_dir/filled_gaps/dbin_basename".

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
\fBfill_gaps\fP should only be run after baler data are collected, combined and cleaned by 
\fBbuild_baler_data\fP.
