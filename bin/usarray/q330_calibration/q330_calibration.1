.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBq330_calibration\fP runs calibrations on sensors connected to Q330 dataloggers.
\fBq330_calibration\fP first checks to see of the \fIcmdorb\fP is accessible and verifies that the 
\fIdlcalwf, dlsensor, and staq330\fP tables exist in \fIdb\fP.
One or more \fIsta_regex\fP (station regular expressions) are required to run \fBq330_calibration\fP
unless the -i or the -N option is specified.
\fBq330_calibration\fP sends calibrations to q330s by using \fBdlcmd\fP.  The specific parameters 
for the calibration are found in \fIq330_calibration.pf\fP.  Only one type of calibration is allowed
for each sensor listed in the \fIq330_calibration.pf\fP. 

In the \fBq330_calibration\fP default operation, a calibration sweep of all stations defined by 
command line argument station regular expressions is conducted first using channel 3 as the monitor
channel, followed by a sweep using channel 2 as the monitor channel.  This guarantees that all
channels are calibrated while simultaneously recording the original calibration signal.  Each station 
calibration is offset by 0.5 of the duration of the calibration to minimize the number of stations
in calibration mode at one time. 

\fBq330_calibration\fP runs are reported in the \fIdb.dlcalwf\fP table.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
verbose
.IP -V
Extremely verbose.  Used for debugging purposes only.
.IP -n
Test mode. 
.IP -i
Calibrate dataloggers and sensors on stations (limited by \fIsta_regex\fP) in the staq330 and dlsensor
tables that have not been calibrated 
using white noise. \fBq330_calibration\fP will check to make sure that both channel 2 and channel
3 have been used as monitor channels.  Missing channels will be calibrated.
The default offset in this case is 0.25.
.IP -N
Calibrate stations (limited by \fIsta_regex\fP) in the staq330 table.  To allow network operations
to condinue, only 10% of the stations are calibrated simultaneously, leaving 90% operational. 
The default offset in this case is 0.
.IP -2
Restrict calibration of stations to using channel 2 as the monitor channel.
.IP -3
Restrict calibration of stations to using channel 3 as the monitor channel.
.IP "-o duration_offset_fraction"
Offset in time between calibration commands measured as a multiplier of the duration.
The default duration_offset_fraction is \fB0.5\fP.
.IP "-p parameter_file"
Name of parameter file to use.  $PFPATH is searched to find parameter file.
The default parameter file is \fBq330_calibration\fP.
.IP "-t start_time"
Only calibrate stations which have been deployed after \fIstart_time\fP
