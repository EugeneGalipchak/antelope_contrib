.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgap_status\fP is designed to determine the status of all identified gaps in a real-time
database.  This program is designed to be run before executing \fIbuild_baler_request\fP.
.LP
Three or four databases are used to run this program.
.nf
.ne 7
    database of all original gaps in \fIgap_database\fP
    database of waveforms currently on balers in \fIbaler_list_db\fP
    database of recovered waveforms from balers in \fIrecovered_data_db\fP
    optional database of filled data gaps resulting from merging rt and 
        baler data in \fIfilled_data_db\fP
.fi
.LP
The program first isolates all unique station-channel pairs from the gap list. 
All gaps are checked to see if the gap has been filled in the \fIfilled_data_db\fP.  
If filled then the \fIfilled\fP field in the appropriate row in the gap table is updated with 
an \fIf\fP.
All remaining gaps are then checked to see if the gap has been recovered from the baler in the 
\fIrecovered_data_db\fP.  
If recovered then the \fIfilled\fP field in the appropriate row in the gap table is updated with 
an \fIr\fP.
All remaining gaps are then checked to see if the gap data exists on the baler in the 
\fIbaler_list_db\fP.  
If exists on baler then the \fIfilled\fP field in the appropriate row in the gap table is updated with 
an \fIb\fP.
If does not exists on baler then the \fIfilled\fP field in the appropriate row in the gap table is updated with 
an \fIn\fP.
