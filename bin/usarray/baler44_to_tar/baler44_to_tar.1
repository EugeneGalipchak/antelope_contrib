.SH NAME
baler44_to_tar \- Makes tar file of baler data for completed stations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBbaler44_to_tar \fP \fI [-v] [-V] [-n] [-p pf] [-s sta_regex]  dbops\fP 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbaler44_to_tar\fP reads balerproc table in \fIdbops\fP .  The balerproc table  
provides information about baler processing including baler14 and baler44 input files, 
how much data has been processed by \fBbaler_msd_proc\fP and \fBbaler_wf_proc\fP.  It also
provides how much information has been sent to the IRIS DMC by \fBbaler_active_to_dmc\fP.  
When a station was completely processed more than \fIdelay_days\fP ago, a tar file is made 
for \fIbaler44_work/STA\fP and written to \fItar_dir/net_STA_original_baler44_data_tar\fP.  
Before running, checks are made that \fIbaler44_active/STA\fP does not exist and that 
\fIbaler44_final/STA\fP does exist.  When complete the original \fIbaler44_work/STA\fP 
is moved to \fIbaler44_work/completed/STA\fP
