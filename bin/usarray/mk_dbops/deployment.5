.TH DEPLOYMENT 5 
.SH NAME
deployment, deployment_schema\- schema for recording various time ranges for station data 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The schema extension \fBdeployment\fP defines the deployment table which tracks the possible 
data availability of a station.  Development was driven by the need to produce a Virtual
Network Definition (VND) file for the DMC.  This schema incorporates time values for the 
actual first and last data available, the equipment installation and removal, an operational
time/endtime range based on certification criteria, the virtual net code, the snet, and the 
sta.

.SH "FIELDS"
.IP "vnet"
The virtual network code.  Per DMC convention, the \fIvnet\fP starts with an "_". 
For instance, _US-TA, _GSN-BROADBAND, _REALTIME.  See 
http://www.iris.edu/news/newsletter/vol6no2/page1.htm or 
http://www.iris.edu/vnets for more information.
.IP "snet"
The SEED network code.  Normally this is the two character network code for the station, i.e. 
AZ, BK, CI, TA, US.
.IP "sta"
The three to five character station code.  
.IP "time"
Time of first data available for external users.  
This is normally the time of the first sample recorded in a wfdisc at the data center.  
Note this date should not be earlier than the \fIequip_install\fP, but could be earlier
than the \fIcert_time\fP.

.IP "endtime"
Time of last data available.  This is normally the endtime in the wfdisc for the last 
sample recorded at the data center.
.IP "equip_install"
Time seismic equipment was first installed. 
.IP "equip_remove"
Time seismic equipment was removed.   This can be left null if the equipment remains
on-site but is no longer part of a described virtual network.  See \fBadoption(5)\fP.
.IP "cert_time"
For ANF purposes, the time that the metadata was first passed along after passing basic
verification checks or the time that data started flowing to external users.  
This can also be considered as the time which the station first
belongs to the \fIvnet\fP.
.IP "decert_time"
For ANF purposes, the time that the closing metadata was passed along or the time that 
the station was removed from external data import.  This can also be 
considered as the time which the station no longer belongs to the \fIvnet\fP
This could be the same or later than \fIendtime\fP and could be the same or later than
\fIequip_remove\fP.
.IP pdcc
Primary data center.  This means something to the DMC in terms of data availability and 
available software.  Despite being the primary collection point for TA data, the ANF is not
considered a PDCC, and IRIS DMC is filled in for this field instead.
.IP sdcc
Secondary data center.
.IP "lddate"
Modification time.
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The original deployment extension schema used a shorter field \fInet\fP instead of \fIvnet\fP.  
You will need to convert any older version deployment tables to this new version.  I have provided 
a script called \fBconvert_deployment(1)\fP to do this.
