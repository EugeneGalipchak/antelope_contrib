.TH COMM 5 
.SH NAME
comm, comm_schema\- schema for recording information about communications setup at a given station 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The schema extension \fBcomm\fP defines the comm table which tracks the communication
setup for a station.  Development was driven by the need to produce a map showing
communication providers for the USArray TA.  This schema incorporates time values detailing the
time that comms were established and when they ended, the type of communications (i.e. "cell modem", 
DSL, vsat, "hosted internet", etc.), the provider (i.e. ATT, Verizon, Wild Blue, HPWREN, etc.), power 
source for the comms (i.e. solar, AC, etc.), whether or not the comms are duty cycled, and the equipment type.

.SH "FIELDS"
.IP "sta"
The three to five character station code.  
.IP "time"
Time comms were established. 
.IP "endtime"
Time comms were removed or changed to another provider.  
.IP "commtype"
Type of communications.  Examples include "cell modem", DSL, vsat, "hosted internet".
.IP "power"
Power source for the communications equipment.  This is likely either "AC" or "Solar".
.IP "dutycycle"
Whether or not the communications are on some type of duty cycle.  Expected strings are
either "yes", "no", "maybe", or "unk".  Comms may be put on duty cycle as a power saving
option or to comply with local site regulations.
.IP "equiptype"
Type of equipment installed.  
.IP "lddate"
Modification time.
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The original comm extension schema used shorter fields for \fIcommtype\fP and \fIprovider\fP.  It 
also did not include \fIpower\fP, \fIdutycycle\fP, or \fIequiptype\fP. 
You will need to convert any older version comm schemas to this new version.  I have provided 
a script called \fBconvert_comm(1)\fP to do this.
