.TH CONVERT_COMM 1 
.SH NAME
convert_comm \- convert original comm table to new schema
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBconvert_comm \fP[-inv] database
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
After January 2009, I changed the schema extension definiton of the comm  
table, to better support additional applications and track additional 
information.  The new schema has expanded field length for the commtype and
provider as well as the additional fields: dutycycle, power, and equiptype.
Because schema extensions do not support versioning, the schema extension/table 
name was kept the same and the \fBconvert_comm\fP script was written to help anyone else
who may have chosen to use this schema extension.  
.LP
The program \fBconvert_comm\fP reads the old format comm table,
and creates a comm table with the \fIcommtype\fP and \fIprovider\fP fields 
extended and fills in the new fields with whitespace. 

The original comm table is saved with a suffix of "-".  The new format comm 
table replaces \fIdatabase.comm\fP.
.LP
\fBconvert_comm\fP converts a single comm table at a time and does
not have to be run in the particular directory where \fIdatabase.comm\fP resides.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -i
Ask before converting comm table.
.IP -n
Just show what would happen.
.IP -v
Be more verbose.
.SH EXAMPLE
.in 2c

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The following error message can be ignored:

.in 2c
.ft CW 
.nf
.ne 6
2009-048 22:50:04 perl *complain*: Table 'db.comm' has invalid length 4758.
2009-048 22:50:04 perl *complain*: If more than one process is writing to this database,
  **please** turn on locking in the descriptor file.
.fi
.ft R
.in

Not thoroughly tested.  

Odd things may happen if the descriptor file basename differs from the 
basename of the comm table that is found by following the dbpath.
