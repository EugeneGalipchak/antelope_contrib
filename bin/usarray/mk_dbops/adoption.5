.TH ADOPTION 5 
.SH NAME
adoption, adoption_schema\- schema for recording information about stations that transition to other data centers 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The schema extension \fBadoption\fP defines the adoption table which tracks stations 
that have been taken over or transitioned to an alternate data center.
Development was driven by the need to track stations which were previously part of 
the USArray TA and were either:  taken over by other data centers; retained for operation through the
ANF as part of the EARN program; maintained collection at the ANF, but are no longer part 
of the USArray TA footprint.  This schema incorporates the time that the transition occurred,
previous snet and name of the station, new snet and name of the station if known, the type of
transition that occurred, and the newly responsible data center.

.SH "FIELDS"
.IP "snet"
The SEED network code.   Normally this is a two character string.  Network codes are provided by 
the IRIS DMC and they should be consulted before assignment if you have a new station.
.IP "sta"
The three to five character station code.  
.IP "time"
Time of transition from original operation to new data center control, or time of operational 
status change at same data center.
.IP "newsnet"
New SEED network code.
.IP "newsta"
New station code.
.IP "atype"
The type of transition/adoption that has occurred.  This can be filled in with up to 50 characters, but
automated scripts such as \fBmk_dbops(1)\fP may fill it in with predetermined phrases.  The current
default phrases are:  \fIEARN\fP, \fIOPERATOR TRANSITION\fP, \fI REFNET / BACKBONE\fP.
.IP "auth"
Name of the responsible data center.  Limit is 15 characters.  Examples might be PNSN, AZ Geol. Survey,
DOGAMI, etc.
.IP "lddate"
Modification time.
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Not sure what will happen if you have two transitions for a single station.  I suspect there 
will be problems.
