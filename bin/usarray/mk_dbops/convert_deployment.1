.TH CONVERT_DEPLOYMENT 1 
.SH NAME
convert_deployment \- convert original deployment table to new schema
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBconvert_deployment \fP[-inv] database
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
After January 2009, I changed the schema extension definition of the deployment
table, to better support additional applications and to attempt to comply with 
the DMC's definition of a VNET (Virutal NETwork).  Because schema extensions
do not support versioning, the schema extension/table name was kept the
same and the \fBconvert_deployment\fP script was written to help anyone else
who may have chosen to use this schema extension convert the old format table 
to the new.  
.LP
The program \fBconvert_deployment\fP reads the old format deployment table,
and creates a deployment table with the \fInet\fP field replaced with the 
extended \fIvnet\fP field.  The original deployment table is saved with a 
suffix of "-".  The new format deployment table replaces \fIdatabase.deployment\fP.
.LP
\fBconvert_deployment\fP converts a single deployment table at a time and does
not have to be run in the particular directory where \fIdatabase.deployment\fP resides.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -i
Ask before converting deployment table.
.IP -n
Just show what would happen.
.IP -v
Be more verbose.
.SH EXAMPLE
.in 2c

converting usarray.deployment

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The following error message can be ignored:

.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
.ne 6
2009-048 22:50:04 perl *complain*: Table 'db.deployment' has invalid length 4758.    
2009-048 22:50:04 perl *complain*: If more than one process is writing to this database,
  **please** turn on locking in the descriptor file.
.fi
.ft R
.in


Not thoroughly tested.  

Odd things may happen if the descriptor file basename differs from the 
basename of the deployment table that is found by following the dbpath.
