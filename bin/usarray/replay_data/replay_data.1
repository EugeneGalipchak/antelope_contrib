.SH NAME
replay_data \- replays database waveforms into orb, uses replay db table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBreplay_data\fP [-v] [-V] [-n] 
         [-d \fItmpdb\fP] 
         [-s \fIstart_time\fP] 
         [-t \fItimestep\fP]
         \fIdb\fP \fIorb\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBreplay_data\fP is the last program in a series of programs of filling gapped data in a database
and sending data to the IRIS DMC. \fBreplay_data\fP opens  \fIdb\fP and checks to see if a replay 
table exists.  It compares the data in the wfdisc table, and only replays data which exists in 
the wfdisc table and not the replay table.  \fBreplay_data\fP calls \fBdbreplay\fP and sends 
the replay data to \fIorb\fP. When the \fBdbreplay\fP program is completed, a DMC 
sync file is generated in the directory \fIsync\fP and sent to the DMC using orbxfer2.

\fBreplay_data\fP will change directories to the directory where \fIdb\fP exists to properly
set up for the sync file transfer naming convention for the DMC.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
verbose
.IP -V
Extremely verbose.  Used for debugging purposes only.
.IP -n
Test mode.  Does not execute dbreplay or orbxfer2 commands, nor change replay table.
.IP "-d tmpdb"
Temporary database name.  Default is \fItmp_replay_$$\fP.
.IP "-s start_time"
Start time of data to process from \fIdb\fP.  The default is to process the
complete \fIdb\fP database.
.IP "-t timestep"
Time step for dbreplay.  The default is 1800 seconds.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
needs to have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh.  Need
environment variable $PFPATH to be set.
