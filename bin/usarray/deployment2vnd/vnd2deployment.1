.SH NAME
vnd2deployment\- produce a deployment table from a virutal network definition file (VND) 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBvnd2deployment \fR [-t | -c] \fIfile\fP \fIdatabase\fP 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvnd2deployment\fR takes an input VND file and tries to map as
much information is availalbe into a deployment database table.  
The deployment table is an extension of the css3.0 schema.  A full 
description of the deployment table can be found by using \fBdbhelp\fR on
a css3.0 database, or by reviewing the \fIDescription of a Deployment 
Table\fP section below.  
.LP
Note, because of lack of information in the VND, not all fields of the 
deployment table will be filled in!  Translating multiple times between
a deployment table to a VND and back to a deployment table will not give
you the same information.  
.LP
VND files were originally distributed in Excel format.  If you save the 
Excel spreadsheet as "text Windows" and separate the columns by tabs, 
you should be able to use this script with the \fI-t\fP option to convert
it to a deployment table.  Alternatively, the DMC is now providing the VNDs
as CSV (comma separated) files and these can be converted using the \fI-c\fP
option. 
.LP
VND files can be downloaded from the DMC website.  As of October of 2007,
this website was:

.SS "Description of a VND"
From the DMC 2006 December Electronic Newsletter:

"A virtual network is group of stations and/or seismic networks, 
representing an affiliation that goes beyond the traditional bounds of 
seismic networks to represent an umbrella organization or initiative. 
Virtual networks associate to recording stations and seismic networks 
either indefinitely or for some limited period of time. It is a grouping 
system that reflects growing partnerships between seismic institutions 
to undertake large projects and act as a single, newly formed entity. 
The virtual network naming system allows these traditional networks to 
have their data represented under the auspices of one or more of these 
initiatives."


The fields in the comma separated version of the file are:
.nf
VIRTUAL NET,NETWORK,STATION,INSTALL DATE,CERT DATE, \
START DATE,START TIME, END DATE,END TIME,PRIMARY DC, \
SECONDARY DC
.fi

They are defined as follows:

.IP "VIRTUAL NET"
The current standard is that a virtual network always starts with a leading 
underscore "_".  Some examples include _US-TA, _US-FA, _US-All, _ANSS, etc.  
See http://www.iris.edu/vnets

.IP NETWORK
The two character network code.  For instance, TA, CI, US, etc.

.IP STATION
The three to five character station code.  

.IP "INSTALL DATE"
The date the equipment was first installed (note that no time is included).  
This is not changed even if all equipment is replaced (i.e. a sensor or
datalogger have been swapped). 
 
.IP "CERT DATE"
The date the data center responsible for data collection verifies that 
metadata is available and starts passing it along to secondary data 
centers.   This field seems open to interpretation...

.IP "START DATE"
The date of the first data available from the given station.  Note this 
date should not be earlier than the \fIINSTALL DATE\fP, but could be earlier
than the \fICERT DATE\fP.

.IP "START TIME"
The time of the first data available from the given station.  

.IP "END DATE"
The date of the last data available from the given station.  

.IP "END TIME"
The time of the last data available from the given station.  

.IP "PRIMARY DC"
Name of data center where the majority of endusers get the data.  This
field has been open to interpretation.  The DMC might have strict requirements
on what can go in here.

.IP "SECONDARY DC"
Name of alternate data center where endusers can get the data.  This
field has been open to interpretation.  The DMC might have strict requirements
on what can go in here.

.SS "Description of a Deployment Table"

In an effort to keep track of all information necessary to produce a VND, 
an extension table to the css3.0 schema was created (see \fBdbschema\fR(5) 
and \fBdbhelp\fR(1)). The fields in a deployment table are:

.IP "net 1.25"
In this case, this is the network code that starts with an "_".
.IP "snet 1.25"
The two character SEED network code.  For instance, TA, CI, US, etc.
.IP station
The three to five character station code.  
.IP "time 1.25"
Time of the first data available from the given station that has been 
made available for import from external users.  Note this 
date should not be earlier than the \fIequip_install\fP, but could be earlier
than the \fIcert_time\fP.
.IP endtime   
Time of last data available to external users from the given station. 
.IP equip_remove 
Time the equipment was removed from the site.
.IP cert_time    
Time that metadata was made available and/or time that data started 
flowing to external users.  This field is open to interpretation.
.IP decert_time    
Time that station was removed from external data import.  This could 
be the same or later than \fIendtime\fP and could be the same or later than 
\fIequip_remove\fP.
.IP "pdcc 1.25"
Primary data center.
.IP "sdcc 1.25"
Secondary data center.
.IP lddate        
Last update time of the record.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -t
Input file uses tabs to separate fields.

.IP -c
Input file uses commas to separate fields.

.SH FILES
.LP
See \fIDescription of a VND\fP for the format of a Virtual Network Definition
file.  These format of these files is based on an Excel spreadsheet, and
as such, I expect it to change at some point.
.LP
As a "best practice", the network operations specific schema extension 
tables might be kept in a directory such as "dbops".  Tables such as 
site, sitechan, network, calibration, stage, etc. normally end up in a 
directory called "dbmaster" in a real-time operations setting.  Waveforms,
the wfdisc, arrival, origin, and other event database tables are normally
found in the "db" directory.  Maintaining a separate "dbops" directory 
allows a data center to segregate these tables that may be essential for 
their operations, but not for a generic real-time system.
 
.SH EXAMPLE
Using the VND downloaded from the DMC and saved as TA_vnet.csv, convert
it and save the deployment table as dbops/mydb.deployment. 

.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
  % vnd2deployment -c TA_vnet.csv dbops/mydb 
.fi
.ft R
.in

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Works with current definition of VND file.  The format is not
well documented and subject to change.

The current VND files do not care much about the time, but rather
only have resolution to the date level.  I suspect that may change
at some point.  However, the deployment table has a full time description
so these fields will not be completely accurate in the output deployment
table.  Do not attempt to translate a deployment table to a VND and then 
back to a deployment table.  You will lose information in duplicate 
transformations.

There are no current \fBdbverify\fR checks to make sure that the
deployment table fields are consistent internally, or to check if
the deployment table fields match what is available in the site, sitechan,
snetsta, etc.
