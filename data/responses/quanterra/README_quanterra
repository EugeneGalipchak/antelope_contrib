1. "F640M" is, in fact, the "ad20m" file used as the first stage in Q730's.
It is a decimate-by-20 filter, to give the first stage output at 1000Hz.
The following commentary is attached:

        These are the actual coefficients in decimal integer form
    used in the DSP. To scale this to unity gain, divide all by 10^6.
    The filter is listed in time-reversed order. You may want to plot these
    to convince yourself of the representation.

2. "F400M", is, in fact, the "ad32m" file used in the Q4120 first stage.
It is a decimate-by-16 filter, to give the first stage output at 2000Hz.

3. "Firfilters" contains all the current filters used in the MSHEAR 
    distribution, except the two above, and the ones in the Q680 internal
    DSP, which I believe you have already (and are published in a number
    of places already)

COMMENT:

It is the responsibility of Quanterra to deliver, in mini-SEED format at 
various sampling rates, uniformly-sampled data identified by a demonstrably 
accurate time label. In addition, for informational purposes, any digital 
filters used to filter and decimate the sampled data for the production of 
"compact" data streams are disclosed as a list of the "coefficients" that are 
applied in a transverse implementation in the data acquisition system.

In all cases, we disclosed the digital filter coefficients, but prior to the 
official release of MSHEAR, the subjective attempt to correct for filter delays 
in the time label resulted in failing on the "demonstrably accurate" count.

With MSHEAR the idea is to live up to the "accurate" criterion sufficiently 
that, for timing purposes, the delays of the filters can be strictly ignored - 
strictly, that is, at least for symmetric filters. For symmetric filters, a 
delay, as you noted, of (N-1)/2 * sample rate is subtracted from the time label, 
causing the filtration process to become exactly zero-phase with respect to the 
time label, which is applied at the point of digitization.

For asymmetric filters, the process is more complicated. A delay equal to the 
group delay (d-phase/d-omega, of each asymmetric filter) is subtracted from the 
time label. The group delay is read from the "delay=" parameter in the 
"FIRFilters" file, given in "input samples". e.g.

FS2D5M name of filter
160 number of points in this filter
1.0 digital gain of filter
5 decimation factor delay=11.641

The group delay is the derivative of the phase as close as possible to zero 
frequency. It is necessarily derived from the filter coefficients alone.

The resulting labeled time series produces, for example, when a step is applied 
to the digitizer, a digitized waveform whose first break begins at the time of 
application of the pulse. The labeled time series can be accurately used, 
without consideration of acausal precursors, to pick first arrivals. If the 
group delay of the filter were not accounted for, the principle benefit of 
picking first arrivals unambiguously would not be available. In addition, the 
particular decimation tree used would affect strongly the required time label 
correction. By subtracting the group delay, to a fair accuracy, the 
characteristics of the decimation tree are removed. The exact time label 
adjustments are readable in the FIRFilters file.

If you are interested in the detailed nature of the waveforms, and want to 
convert symmetrically-filtered data to asymmetrically, or vice-versa, you need 
know only the filter coefficients, and  the information above regarding the 
adjustments to the time labels.
