DETERMINATION OF FIR FILTER FOR PASSCAL INSTRUMENT

The PASSCAL Instruments (72A-06 and 72A-08) uses a Digital Signal Processor
(DSP) to filter and decimate the 1000 sample per second input data down to the 
final output sample rates.  Each of the six input channels are passed through a
series of filters to get to the desired sample rates.  There are three possible
decimation factors ( 2, 4, 5 ) for the instrument.  All output
sample rates must be obtained with one or more of the decimation factors.

There are two Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters for each decimation
factor.  One of the filters has a fast (steep) fall-off and the other a slow
fall-off.  The fast fall-off is a longer filter.  It is used if the output
of this stage is used in one of the data streams.  It is designed to have a
response flat to 80% of the Nyquist frequency after decimation and to be
95 dB down at Nyquist.  The slow filter is used if this stage is followed by 
another stage of decimation.  It has fewer coefficients and therefore will be
faster to implement.  It is designed to be flat to 50% of the Nyquist after
decimation and to be 95 dB down at new Nyquist.  All of the filters have
an odd number of coefficients and are implemented as zero phase filters.

The exact sequence of filters is determined individually for each channel 
according to the various data streams.  The algorithm for determination of
the filters for each channel works as follows:

The various output sample rates for the channel are examined in starting with
fastest sample rate going to the slowest. 

For the fastest output rate:

1) Start at 1000 samples per second.  Decimate by the largest factor.  If this
is too slow then reduce the factor and try again until you get the right number.
If it is too fast then use this as a new starting rate and proceed to #2.

2) Decimate this new starting rate by the largest possible factor.  If this is 
too slow then reduce the factor and try again.  If this does not get the answer 
then go back to step #1 and reduce the decimation factor there.  If the step
#2 answer is too fast then use this as the starting rate for step #3.

3) This is same as above.

Once the steps for the first stream are decided then the second stream is 
looked at.  The same algorithm is used except that the initial starting
point is the output rate for the first stream.  If this is not successful,
then the starting point is moved to the output of the preceding decimation
filter.  This is repeated until you go all of the way back to 1000 sps if
necessary.

This method minimizes the number of decimation stages for each channel, but it
also makes it possible for two channels in the same data stream to have 
different resulting filters.  Consider the case where data stream 1 has a
sample rate of 100 sps and outputs channels 1,2,3 and data stream 2 has a 
sample rate of 20 sps and outputs channels 1,2,3,4,5,6.  The FIR filter for
the channels in data stream 1 would be decimate by 5 with slow response 
followed by a decimate by 2 sharp response.  For data stream 2 channels 
1,2,3 would be a decimate by 5 with slow response followed by a decimate by
2 with steep response and another decimate by 2 with steep response, while 
4,5,6 would have a decimate by 5 with slow response followed by a decimate
by 4 with a steep response.  The two resulting filters would be different,
but only slightly.
