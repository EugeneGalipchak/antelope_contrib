The RT130 uses a slightly different input scheme than the older generation units.

This discussion concerns the new version digitizer in the 130. 

The REF TEK reported bit weight (least significant of the upper 16 bits) is 104.2 mv.

Divide these numbers by 65536 to get the true weight of the LSB, i.e. 1.589 uV
for unity gain.

The 130 differs both the 72A-07 and 72A-08 in the way it achieves all of its sample
rates.  Some of the sample rates are obtained by varying the settings on the Crystal
part in a manner similar to the 07 while others are obtained by a filter and decimation
scheme similar to the 08.  A significant difference between the 130 and the 08 is that 
the filter and decimation scheme does not depend on other data streams.  That is a 
given sample rate will always be obtained in the same manner.

The first stage of filtering and decimation takes place in the Crystal chip.  The 
Crystal chip uses three different filters in its decimation they are:

	CF1	- filter for decimate by 8
	CF2 - short filter for decimate by 2
	CF3 - longer filter for decimate by 2
	
All sample rates out of the Crystal chip are achieved by a CF1-decimate by 8 stage then
one or more CF2-decimate by 2 stages and a final CF3-decimate by 2 stage.

The rest of the sample rates are derived from the 200 sps data stream.  The filter and decimation
is done in the 130 CPU.  There are two different filters used.  One is associated with a 
decimation factor of 5 and the second is associated with a decimation factor of 2.  These are 
the same filters used by the 72A08.  They are the fast roll-off filters.  The additional
sample rates are derived as shown below:


       Sample   Start   Additional   
        Rate    Rate    Decimation 
       ------   -----   ----------  
        100      200         2       
         40      200         5         
         20      200        5,2         
         10      200        5,2,2       
          5      200       5,2,2,2        
          1      200      5,2,2,2,5      



Note:
If any one of the rates 1000, 500, 250, 125, 50, and 25 is selected for a data stream, 
then all data streams must be at that rate, i.e. these are single sample rate rates.

If any of the rates 200, 100, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 1 are selected, then all
are available for other data streams.  This is the only way to get multiple sample rates.
