# Comment: This is a temporary response file for the IIR dc-removal preamp.
# The final response file should have type "iir".  At the publication time
# of this file, the "iir" response file option was unstable when used with 
# dberesp and did not produce the correct response curve. The temporary 
# fix, used here, was to specify the iir filter as a "paz" file.
