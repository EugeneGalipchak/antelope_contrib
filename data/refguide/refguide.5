.SH NAME
reference guide \- overview of parameter files for reference guide
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Antelope reference guide is currently built from the information 
contained in a set of parameter-files. Each command in the reference 
guide has an associative array describing the command. For example 
for the C version of the dbopen command, the entry looks like this: 

.nf
Entries &Tbl{
	&Arr{
		command dbopen
		args char *path, char *permissions, Dbptr *db
		return int
		options &Tbl{
		}
		section Database Operations
		description open the specified database
		private 0
		deprecated 0
	}
}
.fi

The command is listed along with its arguments, return value, a short
description, a table of options, a section name, and the two boolean values
private and deprecated. These associative array 'atoms' for each command are
listed in a table called Entries in each parameter-file contributing to the
reference guide. 

The section parameter is actually a colon-separated hierarchical list
of sections. If the parameter base_section is present in the parameter
file, the value of base_section is prepended onto the colon-separated
list of the 'section' parameter to completely describe the place of the
entries in the reference guide.

Entries with 'private' set to true are omitted from the publically-released 
version of the reference guide. Entries with 'deprecated' are either 
marked as such or omitted from the reference guide depending on options set
in the reference-guide-building scripts. 

For each section, a header may optionally be specified for that section as a 
literal embedded in an array called Headers. For example, the header 
for the C section may be specified as 

.nf

Headers &Arr{
C &Literal{
	#include "db.h"
	typedef struct Dbptr
	{
		int	database,
			table,
			field,
			record;
	} Dbptr;
}
}
