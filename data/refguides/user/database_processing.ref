Database Processing
<commands>

dbprelim_locs [-v] pf [t0 [t1]]
    run dbdetect, dbtrigger and dbgrassoc to create automatic locations from a database for time t0 to t1

dbdetect [-v] [-arrivals] [-plot twin] dbin dbout pf net tstart tend
    run multifrequency STA/LTA detector on channels specified in pf from database db, writing detections and optionally arrivals into dbout. 

dbarrparams [options] db
    measure amplitude, period, azimuth, signal to noise ration, rectilinearity and first motion of arrivals
<options>
-pol	tlead_pol tlag_pol
-ap	tmin_ap tmax_ap
-fm	tmin_fm tmax_fm
-snr	tlead_snr tlag_snr
-filter	type lco hco lord hord tpad
</options>

dbtrigger [-v] [-out dbout] db pf
    trigger location program based on time correlation of detections from database db and rules in pf

dbgrassoc db pf
    spatial grid search based associator/locator: reads output from dbtrigger, generating new origin, assoc and arrival records in the output database db 

dbassoc [options] dbin dbout dbcat timeres_P timeres_S
    associate origins from dbcat with arrivals in dbin, write origin, assoc and optionally predicted arrivals into dbout; timeres_P and timeres_S specify allowable travel time residuals
<options>
-rules r	any combination of P,S,PS,PS+,first,arids=all,best,all
-pred
-arid arid1 ... | -orid orid1 ... | -evid evid1 ...
</options>

dbassoc_arrival [-p delta_p] [-s delta_s] dbout dbin
    search for arrivals from dbout which match origins in dbin, copying matching origins into dbout and creating assoc records.

assoc_rayleigh [-v] dbout dbin
    associate rayleigh wave picks from dbout to origins from dbin, copying matching origins into dbout and creating assoc records.

dbmag db orid author net
    compute mb magnitude for origin orid (or "all") in db, saving result in netmag and origin with specified author field

dbmapevents db {sta | orid | lat:lon} range [-c]  [auth1 sym1 hue1 lit1 sat1 ...]
    make map of events from database db centered on sta, origin orid, or lat:lon with a radius of range degrees.  -c starts interactive mode, ^C kills window.
