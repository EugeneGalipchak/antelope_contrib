## Contributed code for Antelope Python API

This is just a stub for building contributed code and installing to a convenient directory in the Antelope directory structure. Running the standard install from the 'contributed' directory should install to /$ANTELOPE/data/python.

```
python setup.py install
```

This setup.cfg file should contain the correct paths.
