CGGRID_GETMESH	Get arrays of x,y, and z values from a CGGRID object

[X, Y, Z] = CGGRID_GETMESH ( CGGRID )

CGGRID_GETMESH returns three two-dimensional arrays of
coordinate (X, Y) and datapoint (Z) values fora computational-geometry
grid object, similar in structure to the output of the MESHGRID
command and suitable for plotting with MESH, SURF, and related routines.
