PFRESOLVE Get an entry from a parameter-file object

RESULT = PFRESOLVE ( DBPF, NAME [, 'recursive' ] )

PFRESOLVE takes an Antelope parameter-file object and
extracts the named parameter from it. The RESULT will be
either an ordered list (returned as a cell array); an
associative array (returned as another DBPF object); or a
string.  All scalar numbers are returned as strings by this
function; the user must convert them to numeric values with
STR2NUM if desired. The naming convention used by PFRESOLVE
is different than that in the other DBPF routines.  Array
fields may be specified with curly braces, and Table items
may be specified with square-bracket indices.  If the
'recursive' argument is included, PFRESOLVE will attempt to
recursively descend through any array objects it
encounters.
