PFGET Get an entry from a parameter-file object

RESULT = PFGET ( DBPF, NAME [, 'recursive' ] )

PFGET takes an Antelope parameter-file object and extracts
the named parameter from it. The RESULT will be either an
ordered list (returned as a cell array); an associative
array (returned as another DBPF object); or a string.  All
scalar numbers are returned as strings by this function;
the user must convert them to numeric values with STR2NUM
if desired. If the 'recursive' argument is included, PFGET
will attempt to recursively descend through any array
objects it encounters.
