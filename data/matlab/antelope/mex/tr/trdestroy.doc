TRDESTROY free up memory buffers and tables for Datascope trace object

TRDESTROY ( TRPTR )

TRDESTROY frees up the memory buffers and clears the trace
object tables for a Datascope trace object pointed to by
TRPTR. The TRPTR structure is cleared from memory to
prevent attempts to manipulate a freed trace object. Note
that despite the name, the trace object is currently not an
Object in the Matlab sense.
