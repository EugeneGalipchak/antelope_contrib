#  This is a set of extensions to css3.0.  The entries here do not
#  stand alone as these tables mainly reference attributes defined
#  in css3.0.  These extensions would normally be used with the 
#  database descriptor as:  css3.0:takeoff
#
#  These extensions serve two purposes.  First, they tabulate
#  information need to produce and save first-motion focal mechanisms.
#  It save the actual focal mechamism result in a modified form of 
#  an older table used in css2.8.  Secondly, the tables defined here
#  predicted values for measurements in the arrival table that 
#  are based on some earth model and a particular travel time calculator.
#  This should allow future software to not be burdened with matching
#  theoretical travel times to data.  That is, these tables can be used
#  to simply show the predicted value without having to recompute it
#  and worry about whether the results will be consistent.

Attribute mechid
        Integer ( 8 )
        Format ( "%8d" ) 
        Null  ( "-1"  ) 
        Range ( "mechid > 0" ) 
        Description ( "mechanism id" ) 
        Detail {
            Each focal mechanism needs to assigned a unique mechanism
            id.  A seperate key from orid is necessary because it is
            possible for different methods to be used to produce different
            solutions from the same first motion data.  Note this
            key is for traditional focal mechanism solutions only.  
            The moment table is used for moment tensor solutions and
            each moment tensor solution will have a unique orid. 
        }
        ;
Attribute radamp
        Real ( 10 )
        Format ( "%10.7lf" )
        Units ( "nondimensional" )
        Null  ( "-1.0"  )
        Range ( "1.0 >= amp >= 0.0" )
        Description ( "Radiation pattern predicted amplitude" )
        Detail {
                A source has a body wave radiation pattern whose predicted
                magnitude is to be stored in this field.  Because it is 
                a radiation pattern effect it should be scaled from 0 to 1.
                This is useful for conventional focal mechanism, but less
                useful for moment tensor solutions.            
        }
        ;
 
Attribute dip
        Real ( 5 )
        Format ( "%5.1lf" )
        Description ("Dip of a vector")
        Detail {
            Used for strike and dip of a line segment.
        }
        ;

Relation predarr
        Fields (
            arid orid time slow seaz ema esaz dip lddate )
        Primary ( arid  orid  )
        Foreign  ( arid orid )
        Description ( "Earth model predictions of data associated with arrivals" )
        Detail {
                This table has information that connects arrival rows
                to predicted values of related observable based on a
                particular earth model.  It is keyed similar to assoc, but
                the attributes in this relation are all predicted values
                based on some earth model.  This relations can be thought
                of as a supplement to assoc that directly stores predicted
                values of observables rather than residuals.  Note that
                esaz and dip are azimuth and dip of the predicted emergence
                angle of a given arrival in the focal sphere.  esaz is not
                necessarily the same as that stored in assoc which is 
                conventionally the great circle path angle.  Similarly
                seaz and ema are computed from a model, not from simple
                spherical geometry.

        Description ( "Focal mechanism definition" )
        Detail {
                This table stored double couple focal mechanism plane
                data.  It is a minor variant of a table of the same
                name used in css2.8.

        Foreign  ( arid orid mechid )
        Description ( "Predicted focal mechanism properties" )
        Detail {
                This table is used to show predicted first motions
                based on a particular focal mechanism.  It is 
                assumed the earth model used is the same as that 
                used to produce orid so the the angles defined
                in predarr can be used to show inconsistencies
                between actual and predicted first motions.
