	Units ( "seconds" )
	Description ( "day on which trip ends" )
	Detail {
		This field records the end day of the trip. If the

	Detail {
		This records side destinations during a trip, especially if 
		other countries were visited in the meantime. Note the 
		difference between this and the 'hopto' field, which is 
		used to record the vertices of multi-leg trips. The "side" 
		field is useful if the side-trip does not need to 
		be independently tracked as part of a multi-leg 
		journey, or if it is entirely self-contained. 
		If the side trip extends over multiple days or 
		involves countries other than the destination country, 
		the dates of the side trip should be listed.

	Format ( "%-15s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Timezone" )

	Primary ( traveler leave return )
	Description ( "travel planned by colleagues" )
	Detail { 
		Frequently one is informed by colleagues that they will 
		not be available during certain time ranges due to travel. 
		Although most professionals have better things 
		to do (hopefully!) than keep tabs on their colleagues, 
		it is refreshing not to have to continually repeat the same
		"Please tell me again when you are out of town" questions
		when relevant. This table is a place to keep the answers. 
	}

		whether for meetings, collaboration, vacations, etc. 
		The absdeadline and regdeadline fields provide deadlines 
		for abstracts and registration, if appropriate. N.B.: for upcoming
		trips that will almost certainly be made and for which travel plans 
		have already been confirmed, the trips table should be used instead 
		of this table, with trips.pending set to 'y'.
	}

	Primary ( destination leave::return )
