            This is an eight-character code, which, taken together
            with sta, jdate and time, uniquely identifies the source
            of the seismic data, including the geographic location,
            spatial orientation, sensor and subsequent data
            processing. This field is the same as the chan field in

		Station names have changed at several networks to conform to
		the css3.0 standard. Older names sometimes had
		component or gain information tacked onto the
		station code as extra letters, with no official channel 
		code. This table translates a station-only description into 
		a station/channel-name pair.
