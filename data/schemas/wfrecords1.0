Schema wfrecords1.0
	Description ( "Waveform-records storage " )
	Detail {
		The wfrecords schema is designed to track the storage locations
		for waveform records, including paper helicorder records and
		develocorder records. Currently, only the 
		paper-helicorder-record tracking is implemented. Tapes and
		develocorder record tables may be added later.

Attribute boxlabel
	String (20)
	Format ( "%-20s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Text label on a box of helicorder records " )
	Detail {
		boxlabel represents, as accurately as possible, the 
		label written on the box of helicorder records. In 
		some cases, multiple overlapping and mutually-inconsistent
		numbering systems were used on different occasions, in 
		which case the boxlabel simply states what a person would 
		read off the box.
	}
	;

Attribute chan
	String (8)
	Format ( "%-8s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "channel" )
	Detail {
		This is an eight-character code, which, taken together
		with sta, jdate and time, uniquely identifies the 
		source of the seismic data, including the geographic 
		location, spatial orientation, sensor and subsequent 
		data processing.
	}
	;

Attribute endtime
	Time (17)
	Format ( "%17.5f" )
	Null ( "-9999999.99999" )
	Units ( "seconds" )
	Description ( "record end time" )
	Detail {
		This field lists the epoch time of the end of a seismic recording.
	}
	;

Attribute lddate
	Time (17)
	Format ( "%17.5f" )
	Null ( "-9999999.99999" )
	Units ( "seconds" )
	Description ( "(epoch) time of last record modification" )
	Detail {
		This is the last time the record was modified.
	}
	;

Attribute network
	String (20)
	Format ( "%-20s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "seismic network name" )
	Detail {
		This field records the name of the subnetwork to which a seismic recording belongs.
	}
	;

Attribute offdate
	YearDay (10)
	Format ( "%10d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Units ( "days" )
	Description ( "ondate" )
	Detail {
		This attribute is the Julian Date of the end of this 
		helicorder record or contiguous set of records. Both ondate
		and offdate are inclusive. In other words, for a record
		representing a single helicorder record spanning a 
		single day, ondate and offdate will be identical.
	}
	;

Attribute ondate
	YearDay (10)
	Format ( "%10d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Units ( "days" )
	Description ( "ondate" )
	Detail {
		This attribute is the Julian Date of the beginning of this 
		helicorder record or contiguous set of records.
	}
	;

Attribute sta
	String (6)
	Format ( "%-6s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "station" )
	Detail {
		This is the common code-name of a seismic observatory.
		Generally only three or four characters are used.
	}
	;

Attribute storageloc
	String (15)
	Format ( "%-15s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Current storage location for the records " )
	Detail {
		storageloc describes the current physical storage 
		location of a record or set of records. This may be an 
		abbreviation, which is expanded or clarified in the table 
		called storage
	}
	;

Attribute storagename
	String (100)
	Format ( "%-100s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Expanded name of storage location for waveform records " )
	Detail {
		storagename describes the current physical storage 
		location of a record or set of records. This expands 
		the storageloc field, which may be an abbreviation, into 
		a more meaningful name.
	}
	;

Attribute time
	Time (17)
	Format ( "%17.5f" )
	Null ( "-9999999.99999" )
	Units ( "seconds" )
	Description ( "record start time" )
	Detail {
		This field lists the epoch time of the start of a seismic recording.
	}
	;

Attribute writingloc
	String (16)
	Format ( "%-16s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Source location where record was written" )
	Detail {
		This field specifies the source location of the helicorder
		record, i.e. where the record was written.
	}
	;

Relation develocorder
	Fields ( sta chan time endtime writingloc network boxlabel storageloc lddate )
	Primary ( sta chan time endtime writingloc network )
	Description ( "develocorder recordings " )
	Detail {
		This table tabulates seismic traces recorded by develocorders. Enough information is included to locate the box in which the develocorder film is stored.
	}
	;

Relation helipaper
	Fields ( sta chan ondate offdate writingloc boxlabel storageloc lddate )
	Primary ( sta chan ondate offdate writingloc )
	Description ( "storage locations for paper helicorder records" )
	Detail {
		Each row of this helipaper table describes the storage 
		location of a single helicorder record or contiguous 
		group of helicorder records. The presumption is that 
		all the paper helicorder records are in boxes.
	}
	;

Relation storage
	Fields ( storageloc storagename )
	Primary ( storageloc )
	Description ( "storage location names " )
	Detail {
		The storage table expands storageloc abbreviations 
		of waveform storage locations into full names which 
		are likely to be unambiguous and understandable to 
		people searching for records.
	}
	;
