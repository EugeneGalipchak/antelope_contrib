Attribute name 
	String ( 20 )
	Format ( "%-20s" )
	Null ( "-" )

		This is the name of someone to be notified if an event is 
		large or interesting enough. 
	}

	Format ( "%-50s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( " Note " )

Attribute role

	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Professional Association or Title of individual" )
	Detail { 
		This field is intended to give an impression of the role

		process, either as a key decision maker (e.g. State
		Seismologist), interested party (e.g. geophysics professor),
		representative of a concerned organization (e.g. Bureau

Attribute priority 
	String ( 10 )

	Description ( " Calldown priority" )
	Detail { 
		This is the calldown priority, intended to be a

	Null  ( "-999.0"  ) 
	Description ( "Minimum magnitude for notification" )
	Detail {
		This person will be called only if the earthquake is 
		at least this big.
	}
	;

Attribute maxz 
	Real ( 9 )
	Format ( "%9.4lf" ) 
	Units ( "Kilometers" ) 
	Null  ( "-999.0"  ) 
	Range ( "maxz >= 0.0 && maxz < 1000.0" ) 
	Description ( "Maximum depth for notification" )
	Detail {
		This person will be called only if the earthquake is
		shallower than this depth.
	}
	;

Attribute damage 
	String ( 1 )
	Format ( "%-1s" ) 
	Null  ( "n"  ) 
	Description ( "notification upon damage" )
	Detail {
		True, or y, indicates that the party should be notified

Relation threshold
	Fields (
		name regname minmag maxz damage freq_calls lddate
		)
	Primary ( name regname minmag )
	Description ( "Conditions under which to notify party" )
	Detail {
		This table specifies the conditions under which 
		to notify a given party. A party of a given name may
		have multiple entries, for one or more regions of interest.
		A match on any row triggers notification of that party.
		The minmag field is a primary key, in order to allow
		multiple entries for a person for the same region: e.g.
		Anchorage mag > 5 and depth < 50 km, plus any depth earthquake
		in Anchorage of mag > 7. The damage and frequent-calls 
		fields override the minimum magnitude and depth criteria, 
		i.e. checking them off, in the example given, would mean
		Anchorage mag > 7, OR damaging, OR with frequent calls.
