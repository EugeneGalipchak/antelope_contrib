Attribute valoffset
	Real (20)
	Format ( "%20.12g" )
	Null ( "0.0" )
	Description ( "amount by which wfdisc traces are offset" )
	Detail {
		This field gives the constant-offset value, in user 
		units (i.e. with calib already applied), which must 
		be added to the wfdisc time-series for a given 
		data stream in order to recover the full-precision, 
		calibrated value.
	}
	;

Relation wfoffset
	Fields ( sta chan time endtime valoffset lddate )
	Primary ( sta chan time endtime )
	Description ( "abscissa offset values for wfdisc time-series" )
	Detail {
		Sometimes it is convenient to store wfdisc time-series
		with a constant offset removed, especially in the 
		case of high-precision data where the full-scale 
		values do not fit well into the storage format 
		chosen for the traces. This table stores the constant 
		offset which must be added to the calibrated time-series 
		values in order to recover the true absolute values.
