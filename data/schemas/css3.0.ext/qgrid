	Range ( "dlat > 0" )
	Description ( "grid spacing along meridians (degrees)" )
	Detail {
		The dlat field specifies the spacing of the 
		dbgme grid along meridians, in radial degrees. 
	}
	;

Attribute dlon
	Real (12)
	Format ( "%12.6lf" )
	Null ( "-999.000000" )
	Range ( "dlon > 0" )
	Description ( "grid spacing across meridians (degrees)" )
	Detail {
		The dlon field specifies the spacing of the 
		dbgme grid across meridians in radial degrees.
	}
	;


Attribute gridname
	String (30)
	Format ( "%-30s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Name of a particular configuration of grid" )
	Detail {
		The gridname field is intended to summarize the 
		configuration of a particular grid. This is used to 
		keep grids unique, which may have overlapping time 
		periods but different geographical areas or intent.
	}
	;

Attribute minlat
	Real (9)
	Format ( "%9.4lf" )
	Null ( "-999.0000" )
	Units ( "minlat >= -90.0 && minlat <= 90.0" )
	Description ( "lowest latitude of dbgme grid" )
	Detail {
		This is the lowest latitude of a dbgme grid
	}
	;

Attribute maxlat
	Real (9)
	Format ( "%9.4lf" )
	Null ( "-999.0000" )
	Units ( "maxlat >= -90.0 && maxlat <= 90.0" )
	Description ( "highest latitude of dbgme grid" )
	Detail {
		This is the highest latitude of a dbgme grid
	}
	;

Attribute minlon
	Real (9)
	Format ( "%9.4lf" )
	Null ( "-999.0000" )
	Units ( "minlon >= -180.0 && minlon <= 180.0" )
	Description ( "westernmost longitude of dbgme grid" )
	Detail {
		This is the westernmost longitude of a dbgme grid
	}
	;

Attribute maxlon
	Real (9)
	Format ( "%9.4lf" )
	Null ( "-999.0000" )
	Units ( "maxlon >= -180.0 && maxlon <= 180.0" )
	Description ( "easternmost longitude of dbgme grid" )
	Detail {
		This is the easternmost longitude of a dbgme grid
	}
	;

Attribute maxval
	Real (12)
	Format ( "%12.3f" )
	Description ( "Maximum absolute value of a measurement grid" )
	Null ( "-9999999.000" )
	Detail {
		This is the maximum absolute value of a measurement 
		that is stored in a given ground-motion grid. The 
		maxval has the same units as the stored grid, as 
		specified in the 'units' field.
	}
	;

Attribute nlat
	Integer (10)
	Format ( "%10d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "nlat > 0" )
	Units ( "-" )
	Description ( "Number of grid points in latitude direction" )
	Detail {
		This attribute gives the number of grid points in the 
		latitude direction for the dbgme grid.
	}
	;

Attribute nlon
	Integer (10)
	Format ( "%10d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "nlon > 0" )
	Units ( "-" )
	Description ( "Number of grid points in longitude direction" )
	Detail {
		This attribute gives the number of grid points in the 
		longitude direction for the dbgme grid.
	}
	;

Attribute qgridfmt
	String (10)
	Format ( "%-10s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Format of qgrid" )
	Detail {
		The qgridfmt field specifies the format of the externally-
		stored qgrid file. Currently the main format is 'raw'
		indicating a file of network-byte-order, double-precision
		floating point grid values
	}
	;

Attribute qgridtype
	String (20)
	Format ( "%-20s" )
	Description ( "qgrid type" )
	Detail {
		This field describes the type of ground-motion measurement 
		contained in a qgrid, for example pga, pgv, mmi (for 
		Peak Ground Acceleration, Peak Ground Velocity, and 
		Modified Mercali Intensity, respectively). While this 
		information may be implicit from the units and should 
		be implicit from the recipe name, the explicit specification 
		aids applications that may use several different ground-motion
		measures for the same hypocenter or time window.
	}

Relation qgrid
	Fields ( gridname recipe qgridtype time endtime minlat maxlat minlon maxlon dlat dlon nlat nlon qgridfmt units maxval dir dfile foff orid auth lddate )
	Primary ( gridname recipe time::endtime )
	Foreign ( orid ) 
	Description ( "dbgme grid files" )
	Detail {
		The qgrid relation stores references to external grid 
		files, which in turn contain information about ground 
		motion for a given time period and area. These grids 
		are intended to be georeferenced and plottable. They 
		may or may not be associated with a particular earthquake. 
		The chosen measure of ground motion is left arbitrary, 
		indicated by the recipe name which corresponds to a 
		dbgme recipe, although the units field is provided for 
		recording the units of the grid Z-values, if applicable.
		The current schema is limited to regularly 
		spaced, rectangular grids. Unknown values may 
		be represented by IEEE Quiet NaN.
