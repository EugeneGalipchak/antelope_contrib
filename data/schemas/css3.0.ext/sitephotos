	Detail {
		This field records the size of a thumbnail or frame image, 
		for applications that might have several different 
		scales of thumbails or frames. The contents of this field 
		should be determined by the end-user application of the 
		database contents, however a fairly standard approach 
		might be to use the phrases 'small' and 'medium' or 
		better yet an approximate size specifier such as '120x120'.
		For the full-size original images, imagesize should be 
		set to 'full'.
