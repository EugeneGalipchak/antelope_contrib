            This is the common code-name of a seismic observatory.

        Description ( "channel" )
        Detail {
            This is an eight-character code, which, taken together
            with sta, jdate and time, uniquely identifies the source
            of the seismic data, including the geographic location,
            spatial orientation, sensor and subsequent data
            processing. This field is the same as the chan field in
	    css3.0. In some cases, it is not appropriate to assign a 
	    single channel name, for example when the station name 
	    does indeed indicate a multiple-component installation. 
	    Sometimes these cases are mixed in with data that also use
	    separate station names for different components. In these 
	    cases, a blank channel names leaves resolution to 
	    later processing or standardized decisions within software.
	    Often, some information on channel name is available, for 
	    example in the header of an AH file for waveform data.

Attribute defaultchan
        String ( 8 )
        Format ( "%-8s" )
        Null  ( "-"  )
        Description ( "default channel" )
        Detail {
		For multi-component instruments, the newchan field 
		is sometimes left blank so ambiguity in the channel name 
		can be handled correctly. In some cases, such as pick data, 
		the ambiguity is resolved by an implicit understanding of 
		what component is picked on a multi-component station, if 
		nothing else is specified. The defaultchan field is used 
		to make this assignment explicit for multi-component stations 
		where newchan must be left null.
