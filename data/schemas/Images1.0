		for applications that might have several different 
		scales of thumbails or frames. The contents of this field 
		should be determined by the end-user application of the 
		database contents, however a fairly standard approach 
		might be to use the phrases 'small' and 'medium' or

		should be taken from the time::endtime fields. Often this 
		field will be used for the intended length of a movie, 
		for example for 24-hour period time-lapses, which may
		in truth cover slightly less or more time. length_sec
		refers to the amount of real (wall-clock) time represented 
		by the time lapse segment, not to amount of time it takes

	Primary ( imggroup imagename time::endtime )
	Description ( "image group affiliations " )

		This table specifies the names of images or image streams
		that belong to a given group of images. If more than 
		one image exists under a given image name (say, for example,
		a sequence of images from the same camera), all the 
		images together in the sequence may be added to an image-group
		with a single row of the affiliation table, by specifying 
		the time field to be the timestamp of the first image in 
		the sequence.
	}

Relation frames
	Fields ( imagename time imagesize format dir dfile lddate )
	Primary ( imagename time imagesize )
	Description ( "video frames for externally stored images" )
	Detail {
		This table allows the storage of pre-computed individual  
		video frames for a set of images. This table is very 
		similar to the thumbnails table, however the latter 
		will probably refer to permanent files, whereas the 
		frames table may have vastly different cleanup 
		requirements (for example, perhaps saving only the last 
		couple days of video frames). For convenience, the 
		two tables are separate.

	Description ( "time-lapse movies" )
	Detail {
		This table allows the storage of time-lapse movies made from 
		image sequences. The endtime field is deliberately left out 
		of the primary keys in order to allow overlapping movies, as long 
		as they are unique in length, size, and format.
	}
	;

Relation site
	Fields ( imagename lat lon time endtime azimuth vang description stereo stereotwin lddate )
	Primary ( imagename time::endtime )
	Description ( "geographic location of image" )
	Detail {
		The site table records the geographic location of 
		images or sequences of images. Often their will be 
		one entry for an entire stream of images taken by a 
		static (non-moving) camera, giving the location of 
		the camera along with a short description of the site.
		If this camera is part of a stereo pair, the stereo 
		and stereotwin fields explain the relationship. 
	}
	;

Relation thumbnails
	Fields ( imagename time imagesize format dir dfile lddate )
	Primary ( imagename time imagesize )
	Description ( "thumbnails for externally stored images" )
