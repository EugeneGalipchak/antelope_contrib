Schema Techcomp1.0
	Description ( "Schema for Technology Components" )
	Detail {
		This schema tracks the technology components installed 
		on a machine or cluster of machines. It may be used 
		for software or hardware, though it was designed mainly 
		for software. Additional fields (e.g. for "soft" vs "hard", 
		or for vendor etc) might be useful if it gets used often
		for hardware.
	}
	Timedate lddate
	;

Attribute comp
	String (50)
	Format ( "%-50s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Technology Component" )
	Detail {
		This is the name of the technology component installed.
	}
	;

Attribute lddate
	Time (17)
	Format ( "%17.5f" )
	Null ( "-9999999.99999" )
	Units ( "seconds" )
	Description ( "(epoch) time of last record modification" )
	Detail {
		This is the time the record was last modified.
	}
	;

Attribute licensekey
	String (150)
	Format ( "%-150s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "License Key" )
	Detail {
		For licensed software, this records the license key
	}
	;

Attribute machine
	String (20)
	Format ( "%-20s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "machine name" )
	Detail {
		This is the name of the machine on the network.
		Sometimes a dual-boot or other 'multi-OS' machine 
		might have two separate names on the network, that 
		are close but officially different (e.g. yukon and 
		yukonpc). In this case it is often helpful to use 
		the name of the 'main' machine in this field, letting 
		the 'os' field distinguish amongst the different 
		operating systems on the hardware platform.
	}
	;

Attribute os
	String (20)
	Format ( "%-20s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Operating system" )
	Detail {
		This is the operating system in which the technology 
		component is installed. Understandable abbreviations 
		may be used, for example "linux", "w2k", or 
		"sol2.8", provided they are used consistently.
	}
	;

Attribute reason
	String (50)
	Format ( "%-50s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Reason for installing the component" )
	Detail {
		This is the reason the technology component was installed. 
		If it's for a particular project, this will often 
		be listed as "project: project_name". If it was necessary
		because some other component depended on it, that 
		other component is listed. Null value often indicates 
		that the technology component is generally useful 
		as part of the infrastructure.
	}
	;

Attribute source
	String (50)
	Format ( "%-50s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Source of technology component" )
	Detail {
		This is a reference to the place where the software 
		was obtained. Often this may be a URL for a freeware 
		package download.
	}
	;

Attribute version
	String (20)
	Format ( "%-20s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Version" )
	Detail {
		This is the version (usually some kind of revision 
		number) of the technology component installed.
	}
	;

Relation techcomp
	Fields ( machine os comp version reason source licensekey lddate )
	Primary ( machine os comp )
	Description ( "Installed technology components" )
	Detail {
		This table itemizes the technology components installed on 
		a machine or set of machines. It is useful for rebuilding
		machines from the ground up if necessary, or when 
		duplicating their functionality elsewhere.
	}
