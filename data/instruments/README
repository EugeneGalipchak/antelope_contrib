This directory contains parameter files for dbbuild for a variety of
dataloggers and sensors.  These parameter files direct the behavior of
dbbuild and it is crucial that the information contained in them be
correct. 

Each parameter file contains an originator and a last_modified date. 
If you find an error in a parameter file, please contact the author to
fix the problem (not BRTT!).

You must be very careful when adding new files to these directories. 
Use the existing files as examples, and read the man page dbbuild.5. 
Typically you will need to add some response files to the directory
../responses.

dbbuild_validate(1) provides some simple sanity checks on both
parameter files and response files.  However, these checks are only a
beginning.  A parameter file may pass dbbuild_validate and still be
utterly wrong.
